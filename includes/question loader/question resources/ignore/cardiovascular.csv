Question No.,Preclinical / Clinical,Difficulty Level,Question Stem,Answer Options ,Explanation
1,Clinical,Medium,"Ruth is a 75 year old woman who attends her GP complaining of a bad headache unlike anything she has had before. She describes the headache as primarily over the right side of her head, occasionally extending to her jaw when chewing or speaking.

She also notes some ‘fuzzy’ vision in her right eye: upon testing, her (corrected) visual acuity is 6/6 in the L) eye and 6/12 in the R) eye.

Her GP suspects a particular diagnosis, and asks Ruth some additional questions about her general health. Ruth reveals she has also been experiencing some pain in her hips over the last few months, which is especially bad when getting out of bed in the mornings, but assumed this was “just arthritis”.


What is the most likely diagnosis?","Select one:

a.
Trigeminal neuralgia

b.
Temporal arteritis


c.
Scleroderma


d.
Hypothyroidism


e.
Cervical spondylosis","The correct answer is Temporal arteritis

Temporal arteritis (also known as Giant cell arteritis) is a medium-large vessel vasculitis classically affecting the temporal artery; consistent with the distribution of Ruth’s headache. This disease typically affects an older patient population, with a mean patient age of 70 years.

In addition to the temporal artery, other neighbouring arteries can be affected:

The pain occasionally radiates to the jaw, when Ruth is chewing and speaking. This reflects  ‘jaw claudication’ due to ischaemia of the maxillary artery which supplies the masseter muscles.

Ruth has blurred vision with some reduction in visual acuity in one eye. This reflects optic nerve ischaemia due to involvement of the ophthalmic artery. This is an ophthalmic emergency warranting urgent hospital admission in Ruth’s case - ischaemia of the optic nerve can be sight-threatening unless treated promptly.

Temporal arteritis is associated with Polymyalgia Rheumatica in 40-60% of cases. This condition is characterised by proximal muscle stiffness and myalgias (e.g., hips, shoulders), typically with a markedly elevated ESR. Treatment for both conditions is with systemic corticosteroids.



Distractors:

Trigeminal neuralgia - typical presentation would be bouts of shooting/neuropathic pain in the lower face/jaw which last only a few seconds at a time.

Scleroderma - not consistent with this presentation. Scleroderma features a wide range of clinical manifestations including plaque formation, Raynaud's phenomenon, cuteaneous sclerosis, finger swelling, interstitial lung disease, GORD, renal impairment, myocardial disease, arthritis, tenosynovitis, muscle weakness and myalgia.

Hypothyroidism - hypothyroidism is a valid differential diagnosis, however it is less likely as this is a fairly acute presentation in an otherwise well patient, and the clinical picture is more consistent with temporal arteritis.

Cervical spondylosis - may cause headache, but not consistent with other features of this presentation. A history of neck pain/stiffness, weakness or loss of balance would make this more likely.

2,Clinical,Medium,"A 58 year old Maori patient comes into the ED with an extremely swollen and painful right swollen toe, which he rates a 9/10. 



His past medical history is significant for left-sided heart failure - for which he takes metoprolol 50mg BD, frusemide 40mg daily, sacubitril + valsartan 24/26 BD and slow K 600mg daily. He also admits to taking paracetamol regularly for some joint pain, but mentions the paracetamol has not worked for his current pain. The patient also has T2DM which is well managed with Novomix 20 units TDS and some dapagliflozin 10mg daily. He has no allergies. He has a BMI of 35. 



Upon examination, the joint is extremely swollen, so much so that he cannot move the joint at all. The examination is also limited by pain.



Further X-Ray imaging shows some tophi on the toe. Blood tests show he has an eGFR of 88ml/min.

a.
Allopurinol 100mg daily then increase gradually.

d.
Indomethacin 50mg QID


e.
Probenecid 250mg bd for 1 week","The correct answer is colchicine.

Colchicine is a gout medication that works by inhibiting neutrophil migration, chemotaxis, adhesion and phagocytosis in an inflamed tissue such as in our case - patient’s toe with the urate crystals. It has a high renal elimination fraction which is why we need to look at the patient’s eGFR. It is also accepted to be used for prophylaxis of Gout, including when starting urate lowering therapy.

The patient has left-sided heart failure which means that indomethacin (an NSAID) would be inappropriate for him due to water retention exacerbating his HF. 

Prednisolone would also be a poor treatment option for this patient due to his T2DM, and could impact on his glycaemic control. Corticosteroids could raise blood glucose levels and cause diabetic complications in the long term. 

Probenecid is not routinely used as a first line treatment for gout and should be avoided in acute gout flare ups. 

The same principle applies with Allopurinol - which is a urate lowering therapy. It is known that using a urate lowering therapy in acute gout is not beneficial and could make the gout attack worse. Allopurinol is used in chronic management of gout and prevention of further episodes. 

The correct answer is: Colchicine 1mg stat, then 500mcg 1 hour later."

4,Clinical,Hard,"M.Y, a 65 year old male, presents to the GP with bone pain that has gotten worse over the last couple of years. He rates this pain currently at 7/10, which he says varies slightly depending on the day. He complains also of headaches and right thigh pain.

Upon taking further history he said that he fractured his “shin bone” a few years ago from jumping down from a chair in the backyard. He also noticed that his hats don’t quite fit anymore - but is not sure if this means anything.

On examination, the right femur is mildly erythematous and has a temperature of 37.9 degrees.

You order a few lab results as well as order an x-ray of the head and the right hip. The lab results show a normal calcium and phosphate with a normal PTH. However, there was a marked elevation in the serum ALP. The x-ray showed a thickening of the diploe.

What is going to be the most likely diagnosis for this patient?","Select one:

a.
Osteonecrosis of the bone


b.
Osteoporosis


c.
Osteopetrosis


d.
Paget’s Disease of the bone


e.
Osteogenesis Imperfe","The correct answer is Paget’s Disease of the bone.

Paget’s Disease of the bone is the second most common skeletal disease after Osteoporosis. It is more common in men than women and usually presents after the age of 55. The lab results indicate a problem in the bone deformation (with an increased ALP). In about 40% of cases, there is skull involvement.

The giveaway sign is the mosaic pattern on the lamellar bone which is due to an imbalance in the osteoblast and osteoclast activity.

The correct answer is: Paget’s Disease of the bone"
5,Clinical,Medium,"A 67-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department complaining of left-sided knee pain. The patient reports that the pain began suddenly a few hours ago and that he has been feeling hot and sweaty since it started.

He has a past history of osteoarthritis and has received total knee replacements in both knees as a result. He also suffers from diabetes and gout for which he diligently takes metformin and allopurinol respectively.

On examination, the knee is hot, swollen and restricted.

What is the most appropriate first step in the management of this patient?","Select one:

a.
IV fluids

b.
NSAIDs e.g. indomethacin


c.
Joint aspirate


d.
IV flucloxacillin

e.
IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone","The correct answer is Joint aspirate.

This is likely to be a case of septic arthritis. Any acute onset joint pain, coupled with a fever and a hot, restricted joint, should be suspicious of septic arthritis. It should be noted that prosthetic joints and diabetes are both risk factors for septic arthritis. Empirical IV antibiotics should be given to suspected cases. A joint aspirate should also be taken in order to direct further antibiotic therapy and to exclude other causes (e.g. gout). However, the joint aspirate should be taken PRIOR to the antibiotics in order to ensure that the empirical antibiotics do not eradicate the bacteria, making culture of the aspirate and determination of the causative organism impossible.

Distractors:

IV fluids - there is no information to suggest that the patient is hemodynamically unstable and/or requires fluid resuscitation.

NSAIDs e.g. indomethacin - indomethacin is typically the first line treatment for acute flares of gout. Although this patient has a history of gout, he diligently takes allopurinol as a preventative measure. Furthermore, any case of suspected septic arthritis should receive a joint aspirate immediately.

IV flucloxacillin - this would be the appropriate first line empirical antibiotics. However, as is mentioned above a joint aspirate should be taken first.

IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone - these would be the appropriate empirical antibiotics to give in a high risk patient.

6,Clinical,Hard,"A 7 year old boy presents to his GP a week after recovering from a sore throat.

He complains that his joints have been aching and that he’s developed some moderate abdominal pain. His mother also reports that he has developed a strange rash on his legs. On examination, the GP discovers small, violet coloured macules over both his shins which are non-blanching.

What is the likely cause of the patients presentation?","Select one:

a.
Guttate psoriasis


b.
Chickenpox


c.
Meningococcal disease



d.
Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP)


e.
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)","The correct answer is Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

This patient presents with 3 of the 4 characteristic features of HSP - arthralgia, abdominal pain, palpable purpura and renal involvement. Note that renal involvement may occur up to 6 months after the initial symptoms present. The condition is most commonly seen in children between 2 and 8 and also commonly follows an upper respiratory tract infection.

Distractors:

Guttate psoriasis - guttate psoriasis typically follows an URTI. However, it presents with small, scaly plaques as opposed to palpable purpura.

Chickenpox - chickenpox may present with prodromal symptoms that include arthralgia, sore throat and abdominal pain. However, the rash is more likely to feature pruritic papules and vesicles as opposed to palpable purpura.

Meningococcal disease - non-blanching purpura is typical of meningococcal disease. However, it is also likely to present with features of meningitis including fever, neck stiffness, altered consciousness, photophobia and nausea.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura - ITP presents with a petechial rash. However, is is unlikely to feature symptoms such as abdominal pain and arthralgia.

7,Clinical,Medium,"You are a night HMO on ED at a metropolitan hospital and are being handed over a difficult case by the worried intern.

Jim, a 62 year-old man, has been referred to the emergency department by his GP with concerns about his temperature. Upon history, Jim states he has been in and out of his GP’s office 4 times in the last 6 weeks as he has had temperatures over ~38 degrees. He denies any cough, chest pain, changes in bowel motion or urinary habits and any new rashes. The only thing he mentions is he has intermittent aches and pains in his shoulders, back and hips but attributes it to old age.

On examination, his vitals are BP 125/85, HR 88, RR 19, SaO2 98% RA, T 38.3. Heart sounds are dual with no murmurs. Chest is clear with no added breath sounds. Peripheral examination yields no obvious focus of infection. CNS examination is grossly normal.

In the handover, the afternoon cover intern notes that Jim’s WCC is mildly elevated at 15x10^9 and CRP is likewise mildly elevated at 13, however, Jim’s ESR is 57mm/hr. Initial blood cultures are still pending. Renal and liver function are at baseline for Jim.

Which of the following investigations is the MOST diagnostic as follow up to the initial work-up?","Select one:

a.
Repeat blood cultures (x2), FBE, UEC, LFT and coagulation profile

e.
Temporal Artery Biopsy","The correct answer is E. Temporal Artery Biopsy.

In the context of an adult > 50y of age with any of:

-        New onset headache

-        Jaw claudication

-        Girdle polyarthritis (Polymyalgia Rheumatica is often comorbid with GCA)

-        Unexplained fevers, anaemia or other constitutional symptoms/signs

-        Sudden visual loss (amaurosis fugax)

You must suspect Giant Cell Arteritis/Temporal Arteritis as, if left untreated, the inflammation can spread to the local optic nerves leading to permanent blindness. Although it is correct to first work-up for the more immediately life-threatening condition (i.e. CNS infection), an ESR of 50mm/hr (normal < 15-20) is highly suggestive of a chronic inflammatory condition.

 

Distractors:

A: There is no point repeating these tests so quickly, especially the cultures since they are still pending.

B: Reasonable if clinical suspicion for CNS infection was higher, but, in this case, with no symptoms and unremarkable WCC, shouldn’t subject Jim to these tests without good reason

C: As part of a good septic screen, these three tests should be done, but, they are not likely to yield the diagnosis, and therefore are not the most diagnostic tests to be done at this stage.

D: A rheumatological screen is unnecessary at this stage given that there are more targeted tests we are yet to do. You might do these tests if your initial workup is negative to investigate for further causes.

8,Clinical,Hard,"It is your first day as the Rheumatology resident at the hospital, and you have just finished rounding with the registrar, who has told you that the consultant will not be in today. He has asked you to manage the ward whilst they go study. Inspired by your keen pre-reading, you confidently agree and take their pager.

10 minutes later, your pager goes off and it reads: “49y M in ED, L ankle pain +++. Can’t walk, pls advise Ix on pager #XXXX”. After a few deep breaths, you call the ED registrar, who gives you a handover of the patient:

“John is a 49 year old male presenting with 36 hours of severe left ankle pain which has dramatically worsened overnight. He now cannot weight bear. He has no other constitutional symptoms, his vital signs are within normal limits and he is afebrile. I examined him and his left ankle is grossly swollen, erythematous and exquisitely tender. He is almost entirely immobilised by pain, could you please advise on further management?”

 

At the end of the rapid fire summary, you try to ask for more history, but are immediately cut off by the ED registrar who asks you which investigations you want before they can come up to your ward.

 

Which of the following sets of investigations are the MOST important in assessing monoarthritis?
","Select one:

a.
FBE, UEC, LFT


b.
Blood cultures, plain films, joint aspiration



c.
Uric acid levels, CRP, Blood cultures



d.
Plain films, CRP, ESR



e.
Joint aspiration, ESR, plain films","The correct answer is Blood cultures, plain films, joint aspiration.

Acute monoarthritis has many aetiologies, but, the most common are:

-        Septic arthritis

-        Crystal arthropathy

-        Trauma

-        Haemarthrosis

Septic arthritis is the first priority to rule out in any monoarthritis as it has the highest morbidity, whilst gout is the most common but is not as life-threatening.

To screen for septic arthritis, cultures and joint aspiration are a must. There is only one option which has both of these investigations. Plain films will check for any gouty erosions which are a poor prognostic factor for gout and may indicate the need for long-term therapy.

 

Distractors:

FBE, UEC, LFT should may be your default answer for investigations and are ordered frequently as a baseline, but, are not very targeted and will not help you make a diagnosis.

Uric acid levels can be falsely normal during acute gout attacks, so, they can actually be misleading and point you away from a diagnosis of gout.

CRP/ESR are inflammatory markers, but, do not tell you much more about the inflammation. Any monoarthritis will have inflammation and, whilst ESR is more of a long-term marker, it is non-specific. These tests would not help you make a diagnosis and direct further management.

As mentioned, ESR is not a very specific test and is not very useful for monoarthritis.

9,Preclinical,Medium,"Tim, a 65 year old male, has just recovered from his first gout episode and has come to see you, a local GP, for follow up and advice about minimising the risk of a second attack. Which of the following is NOT a risk factor for gout?
","Select one:

a.
Drinking 2-3 litres of soft drink everyday


b.
Eating a diet high in seafood and red meat



c.
Starting a thiazide diuretic



d.
Dehydration


e.
Poorly controlled diabetes


f.
Commencing Allopurinol in the last month



g.
Liver disease","The correct answer is G. Liver disease.

Uric acid production is mediated by the GIT and excretion by the kidney, so, liver disease is unlikely to affect urate concentrations. Gout is caused by precipitation of uric acid crystals from the blood into the joint space and, since it is a foreign material within the joint space, the immune system naturally will react against it causing an inflammatory response.

Concentration of urate in the blood is determined by uric acid and volume levels, hence, the two most important risk factors are purine intake (purines being an amino acid precursor to uric acid) and dehydration.

 

Distractors:

A: High fructose from drinking 2-3 litres of soft drink everyday is one of the major dietary risk factors for gout.

B: Purines and animal proteins are broken down into uric acid

C: Thiazides impair uric acid excretion

D: Uric acid crystal precipitation is based on solubility of urate, if there is less water, concentration of uric acid increases

E: Excessive glucosuria competes with uric acid for renal excretion meaning poorly controlled diabetes confers a hyperuricaemic state

F: Allopurinol is a long-term uric acid lowering agent, but, in the short-term, can actually precipitate a gout attack. It is a Xanthine Oxidase (XO) inhibitor and XO is responsible for converting purines into uric acid. However, any acute change in uric acid level can precipitate a gout attack, hence, starting Allopurinol or any urate-lowering therapy can be a trigger

Which of these additional blood tests would be MOST USEFUL for confirming your suspected diagnosis?","Select one:

a.
Rheumatoid Factor

ESR


d.
ANA


e.
FBE, UEC, CRP","This lady is likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Her age. symptoms of worsening early morning stiffness in her hands and evidence of acute synovitis correlates with RA.

While both rheumatoid factor and anti CCP are commonly used when testing for rheumatoid arthritis. However anti CCP has a higher specificity than rheumatoid factor (90.4% vs. 80.3% respectively). Therefore, anti-CCP is a better test for ruling in the disease (confirming a diagnosis of RA)

RA is an autoimmune disease which attacks the joints, usually in the hands and wrists. Acute inflammation as a result of RA can cause swelling and pain around the joints as Jess is experiencing.

Women are 3 times more likely to have RA then men, and it commonly affects women between the ages of 30-60. A positive family history for RA also increases the risk of developing RA. 

If untreated, it can lead to long-term complications of RA, which are severe deformities of the hand limiting movement and functionality and other cardiovascular and systemic disease.

 

Distractors:

Rheumatoid factor has a lower specificity than anti-CCP when looking for rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, 20% of rheumatoid arthritis can be seronegative, meaning it can be rheumatoid factor negative.

ESR is a marker of chronic inflammation, which would be raised in many different conditions, so is not a useful diagnostic test.

Anti Nuclear Antibody (ANA) is a non-specific marker which can be  used to look for diseases such as lupus. While lupus could be a possibility in this patient, ANA is not the best test for diagnosing lupus.

FBE, UEC, CRP are basic blood tests which will not aid with a diagnosis of autoimmune disease.

","The correct answer is B. Anti-dsDNA

Anti-dsDNA is a highly specific autoimmune marker for SLE. Other specific antibodies for SLE include anti-Smith. Given the presentation of arthralgia, fatigue and a malar/butterfly rash in a young, female patient, SLE should be the most likely diagnosis to consider.

 

Distractors:

A. ANA – is positive in lots of conditions, not just SLE. These include scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, Grave’s disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and some infections. A percentage of the normal population also have a positive ANA. It is a good first line investigation in this patient but would not give a definitive diagnosis. 

C. Anti-SS-A – this test is specific for Sjogren’s syndrome. The typical presentation would include dry eyes and a dry mouth.

D. Anti-Cardiolipin – this may be positive in SLE but is not specific. It would also be positive in antiphospholipid syndrome which is characterised by arterial, venous or small vessel thromboembolic events and/or pregnancy morbidity (recurrent foetal loss).

E. Anti-Scl-70 – this antibody is specific to scleroderma which typically presents with thickened, hardened skin and Raynaud’s phenomenon.

The correct answer is: Anti-dsDNA"
13,Clinical,Medium,"Robert is an 80-year-old male who has come into the emergency department with a 2-day history of a swollen left knee. There was no preceding injury, and apart from the pain, Robert has had no other symptoms. He is a non-smoker, does not drink alcohol and his medical history only includes well-managed hypertension.  On examination he is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. When looking at his knee you see it is erythematous and doubled in size compared to the right side. It is warm to touch and tender on palpation and movement. To aid your diagnosis you perform a knee aspiration, which reveals positively-birefringent calcium pyrophosphate crystals. You start him on NSAIDs and reassure Robert that his condition will resolve.

In the meantime, which test would reveal the most common and likely cause of Robert’s condition?","Select one:

a.
DEXA Scan



b.
Iron Studies


c.
PTH Levels


d.
Serum Calcium


e.
X-Ray","The correct answer is E. X-Ray

Robert has presented with pseudogout (Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition Disease). Pseudogout is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joint space. This leads to an inflammatory response with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators within the joint space. It often affects the knees, wrists, MCPs, hips, shoulder’s, elbows and ankles. There is a spectrum of presentations including asymptomatic, acute crystal arthritis, pseudo-osteoarthritis and pseudo-rheumatoid arthritis. In this case there is a presentation of acute crystal deposition with pain, redness and joint swelling. Investigations involve joint aspiration and X-Ray. Treatment is rest and analgesia (NSAIDs). Risk factors include older age, osteoarthritis, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hypophosphatasia, diabetes, haemochromatosis.

 

This question is asking for the most common cause of pseudogout in an older patient. The most common cause, especially in patients >60yo, is osteoarthritis. An X-Ray may show degenerative findings of osteoarthritis, including subchondral cysts, osteophytes and bone and cartilage fragmentation. Other, less common, causes are explored in the distractors.

 

Distractors:

A. DEXA Scan – a bone mineral density scan is used for detection and monitoring of osteoporosis, which his presenting complaint is not consistent with.

B. Iron Studies – haemochromatosis can also cause pseudogout, however, given Robert has no suggestive past history or current symptoms of this, this is less likely.

C. PTH Levels – hyperparathyroidism can cause pseudogout. A suggestive history may include renal calculi and minimal trauma fracture in a younger patient. 

D. Serum Calcium – hypercalcaemia would also be associated with hyperparathyroidism.

14,Clinical,Hard,"Larissa is a 46-year-old female who presents with complaint of severely cold fingers in winter. She notes they go blue, and then become a deep red.

Examination of her fingers reveals tight, stretched skin. You note, in your full examination, the presence of conjunctival pallor and tiny, thread-like red lesions on the lips. There are no other symptoms or signs on physical examination, with no evidence of any particular organ being involved.

Given the likely diagnosis, what antibody is most likely to be present?
","Select one:

a.
ANCA


b.
Anti-centromere


c.
Anti-dsDNA


d.
Anti-histone


e.
 Anti-Scl-70","Correct Answer – Anti-centromere (B)

Anti-centromere is the antibody which is positive in limited cutaneous scleroderma or CREST Syndrome, CREST being an acronym for the symptoms of calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, (o)esophageal disorders, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.

In Larissa’s case, her described symptoms in her history are of Raynaud’s phenomenon, as well as likely sclerodactyly and telangiectatic lips. Raynaud’s phenomenon classically progresses from white fingertips/extremities, to blue, and then to red. We see a portion of this in Larissa’s complaints of her fingers going to blue and then red.

One way of remembering the relevant antibody is that this non-systemic “central” sclerosis is signified by anti-centromere antibody. On the other hand, if one sees “central” sclerosis as scleroderma, CREST syndrome might be “anti-central” and therefore “anti-centromere.”

 

Distractors:

A. ANCA is generally found in vasculitis syndromes such as Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis or Churg-Strauss – being ANCA positive vasculitides.

C. Anti-dsDNA is a specific marker for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The findings of tight skin and telangiectasia are not consistent with the clinical picture of SLE.

D. Anti-histone is a marker in Drug-induced SLE. Again, her symptoms are not consistent with SLE.

E. Anti-Scl-70 is typically found in Systemic Sclerosis, full-blown “Scleroderma.” Scleroderma will present with a number of symptoms outside of the classic CREST syndrome, including palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, diarrhoea/constipation, arthralgia, erectile dysfunction, and diffuse sclerosis of the skin. Given this patient has no other systemic symptoms or signs of organ involvement, CREST syndrome is more likely.

15,Clinical,Hard,"Jenny is a 35-year-old female who recently immigrated to Australia from Barbados. She presents to you, her GP, with complaint of painful shins of 3 weeks duration. She has no relevant past medical history and has not been recently immobilised. She reports no respiratory symptoms or shortness of breath. Throughout the consult, you note she has a persistent, dry cough.

Examination reveals tender, red nodules bilaterally on the shins. Her vitals are within normal limits. On investigation, she has a raised serum calcium.

Given the most likely diagnosis, what will a chest X-ray likely reveal?

","Select one:

a.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy



b.
Cavitating abscess



c.
Ghon complexes


d.
Hampton’s hump


e.
Kerley B lines","Correct Answer – Bilateral Hilar Lymphadenopathy (A)

 

Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is a classical finding that is present in sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis is suggested by the presence of a dry cough, as well as erythema nodosum, in a middle-aged woman (especially of Afro-Caribbean origin). This is further evidenced by the raised serum calcium.

Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells which involves formation of granulomas. The main cell types noted are macrophages and T-cells, and granulomas can form in the respiratory tract, skin, heart, nervous system and gastrointestinal/genitourinary systems. This leads to sarcoidosis having a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from cough, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease to erythema nodosum and cranial nerve palsies.

Sarcoidosis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion and numerous strategies are involved to rule out other important differentials. These include CXR, CT chest/abdomen, as well as PET scans and lymphatic biopsies in some cases.

Treatment includes NSAIDs, steroids, and anti-metabolites or biologics in severe cases.

 

Distractors:

B. Cavitating abscess would be unlikely given her lack of systemic symptoms, such as fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, or hypotension.

C. Ghon complexes are present in the case of tuberculosis, representing a calcific focus in the lung with an associated calcified (hilar) lymph node. She has few clinical signs for an episode of tuberculosis, including a lack of fevers, myalgias, night sweats, and other respiratory symptoms (besides the cough.)

C. Hampton’s hump is a sign of pulmonary embolism. Given she has no tachypnoea or tachycardia, no reported haemoptysis, no history of immobility and no chest pain,as well as no risk factors like immobility or known malignancy, a pulmonary embolism is unlikely.

D. Kerley B lines are typically present in the case of pulmonary oedema; given a likely absence of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, orthopnoea, tachypnoea, reduced oxygen saturations, or other relevant findings. Furthermore, she has no relevant cardiac or respiratory  history and is therefore unlikely to be developing pulmonary oedema in the context of being (relatively) asymptomatic.

The correct answer is: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy"
16,Clinical,Hard,"Valerie is a 68 year old woman who has presents to her GP with a 2-week history of intermittent lower back and leg pain. She states the pain is fairly central in her lower back and occasionally goes down the backs of her legs to the soles of her feet. The pain is usually brought on by walking, especially down the hill on her way to work. The pain quickly disappears when she sits down.

Upon further questioning, Valerie also reports some numbness in her legs in association with the pain. She has occasionally felt weak in the legs after walking for a while. There has been no change to her bladder or bowel function.

On examination, Valerie is not tender to palpation over her back or in her legs. Musculoskeletal and neurological examination of the spine and lower limbs is normal. She has good peripheral pulses.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","Select one:

a.
Osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine



b.
Cauda equina syndrome


c.
Spinal canal stenosis


d.
Peripheral vascular disease


e.
Diabetic neuropathy","The correct answer is Spinal Canal Stenosis

Valerie presents with the classic symptoms of back pain and neurogenic claudication (also known as ‘pseudoclaudication’); a syndrome associated with lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis is narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal which puts pressure on the cord or sciatic nerve roots. The mechanism of the claudication and paraesthesia in the legs is ischaemia of the lumbosacral nerve roots secondary to exertional demand. The diagnosis could be confirmed on an MRI of the lumbar spine.

Features of neurogenic claudication include:

-        Dermatomal distribution of pain

-        Association with paraesthesia/weakness of buttock, hip, thigh or leg

-        Positional relief of pain (flexion posture e.g., “shopping cart sign”: relief when leaning forward over shopping trolley)

-        Pain exacerbated by walking downhill (narrows spinal canal)

Neurological examination is often normal.

Treatment may include simple analgesia, corticosteroid injections, or spinal surgery in severe cases.

Distractors:

Osteoarthritis is not consistent with this presentation, although it may be a factor in the pathogenesis of lumbar spinal stenosis.

Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency involving damage to the nerve roots at the caudal end of the spinal cord. Features include back and leg pain in combination with bladder or bowel dysfunction, saddle anaesthesia, decreased muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes in the legs.

Peripheral vascular disease is an important differential diagnosis in this case given the symptoms of intermittent claudication in the legs, however the pain pattern is inconsistent with a vascular origin claudication, and instead is highly suggestive of neurogenic claudication. The below diagram may clarify the key differentiators.



Diabetic neuropathy is not consistent with this clinical presentation.

17,Preclinical,Medium,"June is a 70 year old woman who presents to her GP with pain in her hands and her right knee. The fingers on both hands are affected, and June has also noticed some small lumps appearing on her fingers. The pain is intermittent and has been gradually worsening over the last few months.

The joint pain is worse when June is using her hands/knee, and is partially relieved by rest, although never disappears altogether. June notices her joints are particularly stiff and sore in the morning, although the stiffness seems to get better within about 30 minutes.

June has a family history of arthritis, although she cannot recall which type.

Which is the most likely diagnosis?
","Select one:

a.
Carpal tunnel syndrome


b.
Septic arthritis


c.
Gout


d.
Osteoarthritis


e.
Rheumatoid arthritis","Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition secondary to wear and tear causing joint destruction. Common joints affected include hands (DIP/PIP joints), knees, hips, C-spine and L-spine. Pain is exacerbated by movement and relieved by rest. Morning stiffness usually resolves within ~30 minutes. The small bumps June describes on her hands are Heberden’s and Bouchard’s nodes - secondary to osteophytic outgrowths causing joint deformity.

Distractors:

Carpal tunnel syndrome is not consistent with this presentation (mechanical joint pain), instead we would expect neurological features of median nerve compression.

Septic arthritis is not consistent with this subacute presentation.

Gout is not consistent with this subacute presentation. This patient does not have risk factors for gout; and the classic joint in a first presentation of acute gout is the first MTP joint (big toe).

Rheumatoid arthritis is an important differential diagnosis in this patient, but can be excluded based on the features of the joint pain - very mechanical-sounding, rather than rheumatological. Rheumatological joint pain classically is relieved by movement and worsened by rest (‘gel phenomenon’); and may onset in a slightly younger population. Morning stiffness is more significant in this disease, classically lasting >/=1hr due to prolonged immobility overnight.

c.
Anti-dsDNA



d.
ANA


e.
Anti-GBM","The correct answer is c-ANCA.

Sinusitis, haemoptysis and renal involvement point toward a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, previously known as Wegener granulomatosis).

Although it is not diagnostic, evidence of c-ANCA is a highly sensitive finding for GPA.

Note that a biopsy of affected tissue is required to confirm a diagnosis.

Distractors:

p-ANCA - more commonly seen in microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (prev. known as Churg-Strauss)

Anti-dsDNA - is a marker more commonly used in diagnosing systemic lupus erythematosus.

ANA - antinuclear antibodies refer to a group of antibodies that attack DNA and histones. An elevated ANA alone is nonspecific and do not point to any one diagnosis, but may suggest autoimmune disease.

Anti-GBM - more commonly seen in Goodpasture’s syndrome, a form of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Although Goodpasture’s syndrome can present with renal involvement and haemoptysis, it is less likely to present with sinusitis.

Polymyositis","The correct answer is Dermatomyositis.

Proximal muscle weakness is a characteristic feature of both polymyositis and dermatomyositis, evidenced by a difficulty getting up from a sitting position. The rash describes a characteristic “heliotrope rash” that is often found in dermatomyositis, differentiating it from polymyositis.

Distractors:

Rheumatoid arthritis - although rheumatoid arthritis can present with shoulder and hip stiffness, it is unlikely to affect the proximal muscles. Additionally, it is unlikely to present with a rash.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) - PMR classically presents with shoulder and hip stiffness and is associated with temporal arteritis. However, PMR is unlikely to present with a rash.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) - DMD can present with proximal muscle weakness and wasting. However, it typically presents in young children as opposed to older adults.

Polymyositis - as mentioned above, polymyositis presents similarly to dermatomyositis except that it does not feature skin involvement.

Hypothyroidism - easily missed especially in the older population as the more obvious metabolic and mental slowing is more subtle in the elderly. Muscular pain, weakness and falls are key manifestations

Parkinsonism - an important consideration in any elderly patient with weakness/falls/autonomic dysfunction (which could explain her polyuria)

Hypercalcaemia - common and easily missed. Polyuria with bony/muscle pain should alert one to the possibility of hypercalcaemia (the other symptoms are likely secondary to these two primary manifestations)

Reduced Calcium, Reduced PTH","The correct answer is  Elevated Calcium, Normal PTH (B) is a relatively common finding when investigating sarcoidosis. This haphazard clinical picture is unlikely in actual practice, but would present a picture pointing toward sarcoidosis. Calcium is typically elevated in patients with sarcoidosis, and PTH is not elevated.

To summarise the clinical findings of Janice in the context of sarcoidosis:

She presents with blurred vision and pain in the left eye with the likely presence of synechiae, given the pupillary change. This represents uveitis, one of the ocular manifestations of sarcoidosis.

The plaque-like eruptions and patchy hair loss represents cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis, which can be quite disfiguring and distressing.

The respiratory findings show some degree of lung involvement, which may be interstitial lung disease given the dry crackles.

Conduction abnormalities are also common in sarcoidosis, and can cause anything from simple first-degree heart blocks to fatal ventricular tachycardias.

Sarcoidosis is a disease involving abnormal collections of inflammatory cells which involves formation of granulomas. The main cell types noted are macrophages and T-cells, and granulomas can form in the respiratory tract, skin, heart, nervous system and gastrointestinal/genitourinary systems. This leads to sarcoidosis having a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from cough, pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease to erythema nodosum and cranial nerve palsies. One subset syndrome of this is Lofgren’s syndrome, consisting of fevers, polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar adenopathy.

Sarcoidosis is largely a diagnosis of exclusion and numerous strategies are involved to rule out other important differentials. These include CXR, CT chest/abdomen, as well as PET scans and lymphatic biopsies in some cases.

Treatment includes NSAIDs, steroids, and anti-metabolites or biologics in severe cases.

Distractors:

A. Elevated Calcium, Elevated PTH – This would represent likely tertiary hyperparathyroidism and may be seen in the context of Chronic Kidney Disease with hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands.

C.Normal Calcium, Elevated PTH – This is not a usual clinical picture of any particular disease, though may be seen in the context of early primary hyperparathyroidism.

D.Normal Calcium, Normal PTH – Patients with sarcoidosis often have disturbance in serum calcium levels.

E.Reduced Calcium, Reduced PTH – This would usually be seen in hypoparathyroidism, often in the context of removal of the parathyroid glands or infiltration.

24,Clinical,Medium,"Mary is a 35 year old female who presents with retrosternal, burning pain after meals and complains of small, white deposits forming in her skin. She is usually well, besides a history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, and has no other complaints at this stage.

On further investigation, her anti-centromere antibody is positive. Her thyroid function tests are within normal limits.

Given the likely diagnosis, what other manifestation could Mary develop?
","Select one:

a.
A large, tender goitre


b.
A violaceous rash centred around the eyes



c.
Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy


d.
Paroxysmal arterial spasm of the digital vessels



e.
Vertebral body fusion by marginal syndesmophytes
","The correct answer is  Paroxysmal arterial spasm of the digital vessels (D) is Raynaud’s phenomenon, which is a feature of CREST Syndrome in Mary. The five findings in CREST are calcinosis cutis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, oesophageal disorders, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia. Given the signs of oesophageal disorder (with her likely gastro-oesophageal reflux disease) and calcinosis cutis (white deposits in the skin), one’s focus shifts towards CREST Syndrome. The positive anti-centromere antibody further evidences this diagnosis.

 

Distractors:

A.A large, tender goitre – this would usually be seen in the context of thyroid dysfunction (e.g. Grave’s Disease). Given her lack of thyroid dysfunction, this is unlikely. A large, tender goitre might make you suspect a process like subacute thyroiditis, but would typically present with a hyperthyroid or hypothyroid picture.

B. A violaceous rash centred around the eyes ­­– this would usually represent the heliotrope rash classical for dermatomyositis. Mary would usually present, in this case, with proximal muscle weakness and cutaneous manifestations such as the heliotrope rash, shawl sign, or Gottron’s papules.

C. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy ­– this is usually a finding in sarcoidosis. As another syndrome which affects numerous body systems, it’s important to consider presentations with symptoms that don’t add up. However, her lack of clear respiratory involvement or other complaints, as well as the positive anti-centromere, points away from this. Furthermore, calcinosis cutis is not usually seen in sarcoidosis.

E. Vertebral body fusion by marginal syndesmophytes – this is called “bamboo spine” radiographically and clinically and is usually related to ankylosing spondylitis. Mary does not complain of systemic symptoms (such as fatigue or weight loss) or the usual arthralgias, inflammatory arthritis, or ocular symptoms.

The correct answer is: Paroxysmal arterial spasm of the digital vessels"
25,Clinical,Medium,"Vanessa is a 36-year-old female who is visiting her Rheumatologist for follow up regarding her Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). She has been taking high doses of prednisolone to manage frequent flare ups whilst on hydroxychloroquine. She is started on a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, Belimumab, in an attempt to gain better control of her symptoms. 

When discussing the side effects of Belimumab, which of the following is essential to mention?
","Select one:

a.
Liver Cirrhosis


b.
Osteoporosis


c.
Pancreatitis


d.
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)



e.
Retinal Damage

","The correct answer is Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML).

Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat SLE. An important side effect is PML. PML is a serious, life-threatening brain infection. Patients starting on Belimumab should be aware of this risk and inform their healthcare provider if they notice any memory loss, dizziness, difficulty talking or walking, or loss of vision.

Distractors:

Liver cirrhosis – side effect of methotrexate

Osteoporosis – side effect of corticosteroids

Pancreatitis – side effect of azathioprine

Retinal damage – side effect of hydroxychloroquine

 

General Information:

SLE is a chronic inflammatory multi-system disease characterised by production of autoantibodies. The aetiology is multi-factorial and not fully understood – involves genetic and environmental factors (UV radiation, smoking, infection, vitamin D deficiency). There is also a subset of drug-induced lupus which can be caused by a range of medications including, phenytoin, anti-hypertensives, isoniazid and the oral contraceptive pill. This type often involved anti-histone antibodies and resolves with discontinuation of the drug.

The clinical manifestations/diagnosis of SLE can be remembered using MD SOAP BRAIN: Malar rash, Discoid rash, Serositis, Oral ulcers, ANA, Photosensitivity, Blood, Renal, Arthritis, Immune, Neurologic. It has pattern of exacerbation and remission. It is more common in females of childbearing age. Investigations involve ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, serum complement (C3, C4) and antiphospholipid antibodies. Anti-dsDMA and anti-Sm are the most specific for diagnosis. Treatment aims for inducing remission and avoiding long-term steroid use. This is generally coordinated by a rheumatologist. Corticosteroids are used for acute flare ups. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (csDMARDs) include azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate. Belimumab and rituximab are biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARDs). Hydroxychloroquine is generally recommended as first line, but treatment choices are guided by the patient’s response and combinations are often used.

26,Clinical,Medium,"Stacy is a 25-year-old female who is visiting her Rheumatologist for follow up regarding her Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Her symptoms have been well controlled with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), but she is particularly concerned about what will happen if she becomes pregnant. Given the increased risk flare ups during pregnancy which treatment would be most appropriate treatment for SLE during pregnancy?","Select one:

a.
Azathioprine


b.
Belimumab


c.
Cyclophosphamide


d.
Hydroxychloroquine


e.
Methotrexate","The correct answer is Hydroxychloroquine.

No medications used for the treatment of SLE are absolutely safe during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine is a TGA category D drug, however, studies have shown hydroxychloroquine can be safely used for flares in disease activity. Guidelines generally recommended it to be continue during pregnancy. This is especially important in severe disease where flare ups would be detrimental to both the mother and foetus.

Distractors:

Azathioprine – not recommended in pregnancy, TGA category D

Belimumab – not recommended in pregnancy, not enough research has been done on its effects.

Cyclophosphamide – not recommended in pregnancy, TGA category D

Methotrexate – not recommended in pregnancy, TGA category D

TGA category D = drugs which have caused, are suspected to have caused or may be expected to cause, an increased incidence of human foetal malformations or irreversible damage.

27,Clinical,Medium,"Brad is a 52-year-old male who has been in hospital for the past two weeks to treat acute pulmonary oedema related to his congestive cardiac failure. On ward rounds today he complained of a red, swollen and very painful left big toe. Your examination confirms this, and you plan for a joint aspiration. Given your strong suspicion of gout you also start Brad on colchicine in the meantime. When charting this you look through his other medications. Which of the following may have preceded his acute attack of gout?","Select one:

a.
Bisoprolol


b.
Captopril


c.
Furosemide


d.
Losartan


e.
Paracetamol","The correct answer is Furosemide.

Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat fluid overload. Diuretics are the most important cause of secondary gout. Two-thirds of uric acid excretion is via the kidneys (1/3 gastrointestinal tract) and dehydration and diuretics increase the risk of gout.

Distractors:

Bisoprolol – beta-blocker, not associated with an increased risk of gout

Captopril – ACE inhibitor, not associated with an increased risk of gout

Losartan – angiotensin receptor blocker, not associated with an increased risk of gout

Paracetamol – analgesia, not associated with an increased risk of gout


General information:

Gout involves  the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the body. This affects the joints, soft tissue and kidneys. Symptoms include joint pain and swelling which may be part of an acute attack or chronic gouty arthritis. Kidney manifestations include nephrolithiasis and chronic urate nephropathy which may progress to chronic kidney disease.

Risk factors are related to increased serum uric acid concentration – purine-rich foods (meat, seafood), alcohol, fructose-sweetened drinks, diuretics, dehydration. Hypertension, chronic kidney disease, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes and obesity are also risk factors. When serum uric acid concentration is greater than 0.54 mmol/L the incidence of gout increased exponentially.

Definitive diagnosis is with a joint aspiration showing monosodium urate crystals. Treatment for acute gout is symptomatic with an NSAID or prednisolone or colchicine. Long-term management is urate lowering therapy with allopurinol.

28,Clinical,Medium,"Matt is a 48-year-old male who is visiting his GP to discuss management of his gout. He has had multiple episode of acute gout affecting his first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Additionally, he has suffered from recurrent kidney stones. This has caused significant distress for Matt as he has only used pain-relief in the past and is troubled by the recurrence of his gout.  The GP decides to start him on allopurinol and colchicine. 

Which of the following statements best describes how allopurinol works to reduce attacks of gout?
","Select one:

a.
Binding to the kidneys’ organic anion transporter



b.
Increased excretion of uric acid in the urine



c.
Increased hepatic excretion of uric acid


d.
Inhibits superoxide anion production


e.
Inhibits xanthine oxidase to block production of uric acid

","The correct answer is: Inhibits xanthine oxidase to block production of uric acid.

Allopurinol is a xanthine-oxidase inhibitor. This prevents the oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid.

Distractors:

Binding to the kidneys’ organic anion transporter – involved in the mechanism of Probenecid. It is a second-line medication used to lower uric acid levels. Normally uric acid is reabsorbed by the kidneys’ organic anion transporter (OAT). When probenecid is present It binds preferentially to the OAT increasing uric acid excretion in the urine and lowering serum levels of uric acid.

Increased excretion of uric acid in the urine – part of the mechanism of action of Probenecid (above).

Increased hepatic excretion of uric acid – uric acid is not excreted via the liver. 2/3 is via the kidneys and 1/3 via the gastrointestinal tract.

Inhibits superoxide anion production – part of the proposed mechanisms of colchicine’s action in gout. Colchicine additionally reduces the efficacy of the inflammatory response to urate crystals – inhibiting activation and migration of neutrophils, interrupting mast cell degranulation.

29,Clinical,Medium,"You are a resident in a metropolitan ED. Dave is a 22 year old male who comes into the ED after being stabbed in his thigh with a broken beer bottle during night out. You suture the wound then admit him to SSU to monitor him overnight. You start him on 2.5mg of oxycodone, but find he is still complaining of pain. You prescribe 5mg oxycodone which offers some relief but he notes he doesn’t still feel great and wants more if possible. You examine him and find your sutures staying together well despite swelling. Through checking his pulses and neurological exam, he appears neurovascularly intact. His power is 5/5 symmetrically although does complain of pain with passive stretching on his affected leg. What is the most appropriate next action for you?","Select one:

a.
Increase analgesia to 5-10mg oxycodone, write a naloxone PRN dose


b.
Order an ultrasound of the thigh and check clotting times



c.
Urgent ortho/plastics referral


d.
Cease all narcotics, call addiction medicine


e.
Ask for a physiotherapy review, continue current pain relief","The correct answer is C. Urgent ortho/plastics referral

This is a case of compartment syndrome until it can be effectively ruled out, hence why referral is required. The man needs urgent surgical intervention, or he will lose his leg. While he is neurovascularly intact, this does not rule out compartment syndrome. Pulses can remain even in advanced compartment syndrome. Continuously escalating pain requirements is the most significant red flag of compartment syndrome.

 

Distractors:

A.     Increase analgesia to 5-10mg oxycodone, write a naloxone PRN dose

This is a reasonable plan when increasing opioid doses however it fails to recognise the significance of the compartment syndrome.

B.     Order an ultrasound of the thigh and check clotting times

This would be a reasonable response if a DVT was suspected (and there may be a dvt) however compartment syndrome takes precedence over essentially any other non-life threatening condition

C.    Cease all narcotics, call addiction medicine

While opioid addicts do present to emergency departments this is not a typical presentation due to the clear precipitating injury. Addicts will typically use a less visible pain eg a kidney stone

D.     Ask for a physiotherapy review, continue current pain relief.

This does not take into the significance of the compartment syndrome.

30,Clinical,Medium,"Jeffrey is a 36 year old male who comes in complaining of knee pain for the past week, to the point where he is unable to walk on it. He is afebrile. You take a detailed history and find it is unremarkable aside from a chlamydia infection a few weeks prior which was managed with a stat dose of azithromycin.

What symptom is Jeffrey most likely to also have?
","Select one:

a.
Salmon coloured plaques with silvery scale on his elbows and knees


b.
Intense pain on moving the knee in any direction


c.
Lower back pain and stiffness


d.
Anterior uveitis


e.
Unilaterally swollen large big toe","The correct answer is C – Lower back pain and stiffness

This is most likely reactive arthritis due to large joint asymmetrical mono/oligoarthritis following a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is typically caused by a sexually transmitted infection or gastrointestinal infections. As reactive arthritis is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy (with psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis), it can cause back pain and commonly does.

 

Distractors:

A – Salmon coloured plaques with silvery scale on his elbows and knees

This a description of psoriasis. Psoriasis can cause an arthritis, but there is little to suggest this arthritis is psoriatic.

B – Intense pain on moving the knee in any direction

This presentation suggests septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is unlikely given the subacute presentation, and the fact that he is afebrile.

D – Anterior uveitis

This is part of Reiter's triad (urethritis, uveitis, arthritis) and a possible symptom of reactive arthritis. However only a small amount of people with reactive arthritis present with uveitis.

E – Unilaterally swollen large big toe

This suggests gout. There are no other indicators of gout in the stem.
