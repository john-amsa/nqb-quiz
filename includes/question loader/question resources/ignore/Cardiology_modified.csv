Furthermore, the absence of ischaemic changes on ECG makes an AMI less likely. Aspirin and GTN aren't indicated unless there is evidence of myocardial ischaemia. Continuous ECG monitoring is also not essential given the unlikelihood of cardiac pathology. Many diseases can mimic an AMI and thus exclusion of other diagnoses is the next best step. Erect chest x-ray can pick up other pathologies which may also cause chest pain such as a perforated peptic ulcer.
