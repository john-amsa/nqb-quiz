He attends his GP after experiencing an episode of breathlessness, palpitations and dizziness during a game of soccer. The episode came on when Jack was running, and lasted around 15 seconds, seeming to resolve after he sat down on the bench. Jack vaguely recalls experiencing episodes like this in the past, but only when exercising and never this severe. His GP performs an ECG in the clinic (while Jack is asymptomatic), which is normal. The GP recommends a Holter monitor to record Jack’s heart activity should he have another episode. Unfortunately, the following week at his soccer game, Jack suddenly falls unconscious. He is able to be revived after bystanders perform CPR. 
What is Jack's most likely diagnosis?","[""Atrial fibrillation"", ""Aortic stenosis"", ""Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)"", ""Vasovagal syncope"", ""Transient ischaemic attacks""]",C,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM),"HOCM is a genetic condition characterised by ventricular hypertrophy to the point where the cardiac outflow tract is obstructed. It is an important cause of sudden cardiac death in otherwise healthy young people. Symptoms may include dyspnoea, chest pain, palpitations and syncope. Symptomatic episodes may be precipitated by physical exertion. 
A cardiac examination may reveal an ejection systolic murmur (increased by valsalva manoeuvre). Definitive diagnosis is by echocardiography. Treatment modalities include medical (e.g., beta blockers, calcium-channel blockers) and surgical (removal of outflow tract obstruction) options.
Distractors:
Atrial fibrillation - It would be unusual for atrial fibrillation to present intermittently in a healthy 23-year-old with no known risk factors (e.g. alcohol or illicit drug use). This is not the most likely answer.
Vasovagal syncope - Although dizziness and palpitations can precede vasovagal syncope, there is no indication to suggest that Jack is experiencing a presyncopal episode related to increased vagal tone (e.g. a strong emotional stimulus). 
Aortic stenosis - This condition is usually caused by age-related calcification of the aortic valve, and typically presents with some combination of angina, syncope and dyspnoea (but is often detected incidentally with a murmur on cardiac auscultation). It is unlikely that Jack’s symptoms are related to aortic stenosis, particularly due to his young age.
Transient ischaemic attacks - Jack has no risk factors for transient ischaemic attacks. ‘Mini-strokes’ typically occur in older people with vascular/stroke risk factors, and would not usually present with palpitations and breathlessness.

It seems that just a couple of days after her GP appointment, Jane presented to the hospital with a sharp central chest pain and dyspnoea secondary to pain on deep breathing. At the time of presentation she was unable to lie flat due to worsening of her chest pain, so she was forced to sit upright in a chair. She was noted to be tachycardic and went on to receive an ECG among other investigations.
What is the diagnosis that Jane probably received in the hospital?","[""Dressler\u2019s syndrome"", ""Pulmonary embolism"", ""Pneumonia"", ""Viral pericarditis"", ""Costochondritis""]",D,Viral pericarditis,"Jane’s history is suggestive of a post-viral phenomenon. The central, pleuritic chest pain and postural element are consistent with pericarditis. A viral aetiology is common in acute pericarditis, with many cases preceded by a self-limiting gastrointestinal or upper respiratory viral infection. 
Diagnosis is often made clinically, but investigations may be performed to exclude important differential diagnoses. The most important sign clinically is a pericardial friction rub. Before diagnosing viral pericarditis, attention should be given to excluding other types of infective pericarditis (e.g., bacterial, tuberculous).
Distractors:
Pulmonary embolism - although this is an important differential diagnosis in the context of pleuritic chest pain, Jane has no risk factors for PE and no examination findings to suggest a DVT. 
Dressler’s syndrome - this syndrome describes pericarditis secondary to cardiac injury, usually post myocardial infarction (MI). Classically, this syndrome (although very rare) presents 2-8 weeks post-MI. There is no suggestion that Jane has had a recent MI, nor does she have any cardiac risk factors.
Costochondritis - this is a musculoskeletal condition, characterised by inflammation of the costal cartilage at the costosternal junction. Jane’s symptoms and signs are not consistent with costochondritis - a telltale sign of which is chest tenderness over the inflamed area(s). 
Pneumonia - community acquired pneumonia may present in this way, but is not the most likely diagnosis. Jane’s case is more suggestive of a post-viral, cardiac phenomenon.

Malignant hypertension is defined by a blood pressure of >180/120 mmHg. 
Causes include medication non-compliance, renal disease, pheochromocytoma, coarctation of the aorta, CNS disorders and recreational drugs such as amphetamines or cocaine.  It typically has a poor prognosis due to end-organ damage and complications such as acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, acute kidney injury and intracerebral haemorrhage. 
Malignant hypertension can present with symptoms such as headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, chest or back pain and dyspnoea.
Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency and should thus be treated urgently. The aim of management is rapid reduction of blood pressure. If there is no evidence of end-organ damage and the patient is symptomatic, oral antihypertensives may be used. However, this patient is likely to benefit from IV antihypertensive therapy.  

Distractors:
Counsel on management of substance abuse: as amphetamines and cocaine have the potential to cause malignant hypertension, it is important that the patient looks to cease his substance abuse. However, the more appropriate immediate management is to treat the malignant hypertension with antihypertensives. 
Discharge with advice on salt and fluid restriction: this may be reasonable advice for a patient’s first presentation with asymptomatic hypertension. However, malignant hypertension requires more immediate blood pressure reduction. 
Discharge with oral perindopril: as was mentioned above, the presence of symptoms in this patient indicates that he requires IV antihypertensive treatment.
Admit for observation: the patient should be admitted. However, it is important that they are given some form of antihypertensive therapy in order to rapidly reduce their blood pressure. Not doing so may accelerate end-organ damage and is likely to significantly worsen his prognosis.

He has no significant medical history. On examination he is rapidly deteriorating. His airway is patent and the trachea is not deviated. His blood pressure is 90/57mmHg.

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate treatment?","[""Synchronised DC Cardioversion"", ""Pericardiocentesis"", ""Needle decompression thoracostomy"", ""Vigorous fluid resuscitation"", ""Emergency thoracotomy""]",B,Pericardiocentesis,"Jordan is likely suffering from a cardiac tamponade. He has undergone major trauma and is currently exhibiting Beck’s triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds and distension of the neck veins). This is a very concerning physical finding and thus pericardiocentesis should be attempted as soon as possible, usually guided by ultrasound.
Tamponade is a condition in which accumulation of fluid occurs in the pericardial sac, interfering with the function of the heart. It can be rapidly fatal. In the acute phase, this is often caused by haemopericardium in the context of trauma; however, it can occur in pericarditis secondary to a severe pericardial effusion. It is less likely to occur chronically but may do so in the context of conditions such as autoimmune disease, neoplasms, or uraemia.
Exams will often test you on Beck’s Triad and so this is worth learning. It is typically diagnosed via emergency ultrasound/echocardiogram and presents as increased fluid in the pericardial sac with universal cardiac dysfunction. Treatment is resuscitation, pericardiocentesis, and cardiothoracic referral for consideration of pericardial surgery when the patient recovers.
Distractors:
Emergency thoracotomy is not necessary in this situation. Jordan’s situation is dire, but it is not dire enough to open the chest urgently!
Needle decompression thoracostomy is performed in cases of tension pneumothorax. If there was evident respiratory distress with tracheal deviation, this would be the correct treatment.
Synchronised DC Cardioversion is usually required in the case of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The raised JVP, distant heart sounds and history of trauma is evidence toward tamponade.
Vigorous fluid resuscitation is unlikely to improve James’ hypotension due to his cardiac dysfunction and so is not necessary.

There are a number of devastating complications of aortic dissection, all of which may culminate in death. Inferior myocardial infarction occurs in the context of damage to the right coronary artery, secondary to damage of the aortic root in an extensive proximal aortic dissection.

She feels his exercise tolerance is also reducing as he is becoming more and more short of breath. There is no other significant past medical history, except for a paternal uncle who died suddenly and unexpectedly at a young age. Examination reveals bilateral basal crackles on auscultation of his posterior chest. Echocardiogram reveals a thickened left ventricle with a degree of heart failure.
Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following physical findings would you expect to find in Jimmy?","[""Triple apical impulse"", ""Water hammer pulse"", ""Irregularly irregular pulse"", ""Diastolic murmur in the aortic area"", ""Pulsatile liver""]",A,Triple apical impulse,"Jimmy is likely suffering from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM). This is evidenced by his exertional angina, likely palpitations, and growing exercise intolerance. The history of sudden cardiac death in the family is not exceedingly significant given it is one second-degree relative; however, it is certainly a cause for concern given HCM is genetic. The echocardiogram findings are near pathognomonic for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and so this would be the diagnosis Jimmy would receive.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is an inherited disorder which is characterised by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. It is classified as a disorder of cardiac muscle and leads to a hypertrophy of the ventricles especially. There are a number of genetic foci which can lead to mutations in sarcomere proteins, but all will culminate in a thickened ventricle. Common physical findings include a triple apical impulse and stigmata of heart failure such as pulmonary oedema, as well as a systolic ejection murmur that often mimics aortic stenosis but is loudened by Valsalva and other manoeuvres increasing afterload. A patient may also report feelings of dizziness, angina and palpitations. There may be unexplained syncope as well, especially occurring in the context of sport. Diagnosis is typically made on echocardiogram, cardiac catheterisation, and ECG. ECG findings include left ventricle hypertrophy and stiletto Q waves. Treatment may include use of beta blockers as well as surgery in cases for improvement of severe disease, such as a ventricular myotomy.
Cardiac catheterisation will reveal a Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign in HCM in order to differentiate it from aortic stenosis. After a premature ventricular contraction, the fixed obstruction of aortic stenosis will behave differently to the variable obstruction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Distractors:
Diastolic Murmur in the Aortic Area would typically occur in the context of Aortic Regurgitation. There is no significant history of collagen vascular diseases or other conditions which would predispose him to this and it is unlikely in his age group.
Irregularly irregular pulse would indicate atrial fibrillation. Though this is possible in the context of heart failure, it is unlikely in Jimmy’s demographic.
Pulsatile liver typically signifies incompetence of the tricuspid valve. This might occur in the case of pulmonic stenosis or merely congenital malformation. However, this would not explain Jimmy’s symptoms.
Water hammer pulse is a sign associated with aortic regurgitation. There is a rapid upstroke and descent of the pulse, which will “collapse” on flexion of the shoulder to 180 degrees. It may be associated with a widened pulse pressure. Aortic Regurgitation would not explain Jimmy’s symptoms and so is unlikely to be causing them."

Which of the following would you LEAST expect to find on further history, examination, and investigation of Jenna?","[""Elevated D-dimer"", ""Active malignancy"", ""Oral contraceptive pill use"", ""Elevated prothrombin time"", ""Recent international travel""]",D,Elevated prothrombin time,"Jenna is likely suffering from a deep vein thrombosis occurring in the calf. This is evidenced by the unilateral swelling and pain, as well as the positive physical sign. The fact that the diagnosis is confirmed by doppler ultrasound further evidences this. Thus, we would expect characteristics of Jenna's history, examination and investigation to point towards a state of hypercoagulability. Elevated prothrombin time indicates a state of increased propensity to bleed and therefore would protect against or at least be significant against a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis.  
Risk factors for clotting can be approached in terms of acquired and congenital factors. Congenital factors include factor 5 Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation as well as protein C or protein S deficiency. Acquired factors are much more common and include malignancy, contraceptive pill usage, immobilization such as in international travel, and recent major trauma or surgery.
Elevated D-dimer would also be expected in Jenna’s case secondary to the increased presence of fibrin degradation in the context of clotting of the venous system.
Typically, treatment of a deep vein thrombosis would include anticoagulation in order to stop or reduce the risk of development of a pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism can have devastating consequences and is a major cause of mortality and thus should be prevented against.
Antibodies present in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can paradoxically increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and therefore this should be considered in patients with complaints such as livido reticularis, thrombocytopenia, and obstetric or thrombotic complications.

Distractors:
Oral contraceptive pill usage, active malignancy, recent international travel with presumed immobilization, and elevated D-dimer all point towards a state of hypercoagulability, increasing Jenna’s risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis.

Symptoms depend on the size of the shunt: severely affected babies may develop symptomatic heart failure within days to weeks of birth. Treatment for premature infants involves administration of NSAIDs in order to promote duct closure. If this fails, surgical options should be considered.

Distractors:
Transposition of the great arteries - this is a cyanotic heart condition in which the aorta and pulmonary trunk arise from the wrong ventricle, resulting in deoxygenated blood being pumped around the body instead of to the lungs. Bethany would likely be very unwell with this condition, with severe cyanosis within days of birth, and subsequent development of heart failure. Survival beyond the immediate post-birth period requires at least one persistent shunt (e.g., a patent ductus arteriosus or atrial septal defect) allowing for some exchange of oxygenated blood into the peripheral circulation.
Tetralogy of Fallot - this is a cyanotic heart condition in which four key defects result in the development of symptomatic heart failure sometimes within weeks of birth. Young children with unrepaired Tetralogy of Fallot may experience hypercyanotic ‘tet’ spells on exertion/crying in which they may squat down to increase pulmonary blood flow.
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return - this is a cyanotic heart condition in which the pulmonary veins drain into the systemic venous circulation rather than the left atrium. Depending on the degree of obstruction to the pulmonary venous outflow, babies may develop cyanosis and pulmonary oedema rapidly after birth.
Coarctation of the aorta - this condition may manifest with a soft bruit over the coarctation site, upper extremity hypertension, LV hypertrophy or (in severe cases) hypoperfusion of abdominal organs and lower extremities. Symptoms may include headaches, chest pain, cold extremities or even symptomatic heart failure.

Hepatomegaly occurs as a result of congestive heart failure.
The ductus arteriosus is a foetal vessel that bypasses the immature lungs in-utero. At birth, the lungs fill with air with the neonates first breaths, allowing blood-flow through the lungs and constricting the duct. This process is typically functionally complete by 2-3 days after birth.
Failure of the duct to close can result in pulmonary oedema and congestive heart failure. It presents with a continuous “machine-like” murmur heard loudest over the pulmonary region, bounding peripheral pulses, a wide pulse pressure, respiratory distress, poor feeding and hepatomegaly. 

Distractors:
Weak femoral pulses bounding peripheral pulses are common in PDA due to a compensatory increased cardiac output.
Narrow pulse pressure as per StatPearls (see reference below), “A widened pulse pressure (> 30mmHg) occurs both because of a mild increase in systolic blood pressure to overcome the decrease in distal blood flow due to run-off through the PDA during diastole, in addition to a lower diastolic blood pressure from the run-off.”
Diagnosed on CT CT scans are rarely done in neonates. Almost all congenital heart defects are diagnosed on echocardiogram. A CXR may also show evidence of pulmonary oedema.
Associated with Turner’s syndrome PDA is associated with a number of other genetic conditions including trisomy 13, 18 and 21, Noonan syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome.

If asymptomatic, sinus bradycardias generally require no treatment. However, as he is haemodynamically unstable with a low BP, the first line therapy is IV atropine. Atropine is an antimuscarinic and increases heart rate by inhibiting the vagus nerve. Atropine can be given every 5 minutes until the heart rate or symptoms have normalized (up to a max of 3mg).

Distractors:
Observe for 6 hours, check troponin levels and repeat, discharge if normal
This is an appropriate management plan for a patient with chest pain without ECG changes, but would be unhelpful for a sinus bradycardia.
IV fluid therapy and a vasopressor such as metaraminol.
This would be appropriate for hypotension that was resistant to IV fluids and other interventions, but it would be unnecessary to start a vasopressor before atropine had been given.
Give IV adrenaline
Adrenaline stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and can be used as a treatment for bradycardia. However, eTG lists it as second line after Atropine. Adrenaline’s primary disadvantage is that it irritates small veins so should ideally be given through a central venous line (although can be given through a large cubital fossa vein).
Follow possible sepsis guidelines, take blood cultures, start IV antibiotics.

Motor vehicle accidents are common causes of sternal fractures and they typically present with pleuritic pain localized on palpation to a specific area of the sternum.
While a CT is generally considered the imaging of choice, a normal CT does not rule out a sternal fracture as a CT uses 2-5mm slices to construct an image. As sternal fractures are often 90 degrees to the sternum, if the break is narrow it may lie between the slice. In this setting with a high suspicion of a sternal fracture, ultrasound is quick and effective way of assessing for a sternal fracture if available.

Distractors:
Plain X-ray to assess for pneumothorax/haemothorax.
While this may be useful, the CT would be more likely to show these than a plain chest x ray.

Brugada sign: Refers to the distance from the onset of the QRS complex to the nadir/peak of the S wave being greater than 100ms (half a big square)
Capture beats: Another phenomena where the sinoatrial node is able to transiently ‘capture’ the ventricles producing a normal QRS complex in the midst of the VT

He is a vasculopath with numerous risk factors. Dissection is further evidenced by the tearing chest pain with radiates to the back as well as the degree of hemodynamic instability which he is experiencing. Furthermore, the new diastolic murmur at the right upper sternal border further adds to this as this is evidence of aortic regurgitation secondary to damage of the aortic root. There are a number of devastating complications of aortic dissection, all of which may culminate in death. Classification of the dissection is critical to management.
Often the Debakey and Stanford systems are used to classify it, and can be seen below.

A very quick rundown in words is below.
Stanford A – occurring proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Involves the proximal aorta and can extend past the diaphragm in some cases.
Stanford B – occurs distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.
Debakey I – Occurs in the proximal aorta and extends at least to the level of the aortic arch, past the ascending aorta.
Debakey II – Only involves the ascending aorta.
Debakey IIIa – Occurs distal to the left subclavian. Can extend proximally in rare cases, but will pretty much always spread distally. Does not extend past diaphragm.
Debakey IIIb – Occurs distal to the left subclavian. Can extend proximally in rare cases, but will pretty much always spread distally. Extends past diaphragm.

He's well-known to your hospital, with a long-standing history of renal cell carcinoma and chronic kidney disease. He has been complaining of increasing fatigue, paroxysmal chest pain, as well as orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea for the past one month. He has had numerous episodes of chest pain in the past, which he reports is always improved by leaning forward. Whilst being worked up in the ED, Jared begins clutching his chest and becomes unresponsive. You note in his physical examination distended neck veins, a raised jugular venous pressure, and distant, muffled heart sounds. His peripheries are cool to touch. Administration of fluid bolus fails to raise his blood pressure significantly. An echocardiogram confirms your suspicion.
What type of shock is most associated with Jared’s current presentation?","[""Cardiac"", ""Neurogenic"", ""Anaphylactic"", ""Obstructive"", ""Septic""]",D,Obstructive,"Jared is likely suffering from a cardiac tamponade. He is currently exhibiting Beck’s triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and distension of the neck veins). This is a very concerning physical finding. Given the past history of chronic kidney disease, we can hazard a guess that his recurrent chest pain is probably pericarditis. The pathogenesis of uraemic pericarditis is poorly understood; however, it is correlated to the degree of uraemia and is likely related to waste product induced inflammation of the pericardium. This would lead to an exudative pericardial effusion which has worsened over the past month and finally decompensated whilst he’s been sitting in the ED.
Tamponade is a condition in which accumulation of fluid occurs in the pericardial sac, interfering with the function of the heart. It can be rapidly fatal. In the acute phase, this is often caused by haemopericardium in the context of trauma; however, it can occur in pericarditis secondary to a severe pericardial effusion. This may be in the context of conditions such as autoimmune disease, neoplasms, or uraemia.
Exams will often test you on the Beck’s Triad and so this is worth learning. It is typically diagnosed via emergency ultrasound/echocardiogram and presents as increased fluid in the pericardial sac with universal cardiac dysfunction. Treatment is resuscitation, pericardiocentesis, and cardiothoracic referral for consideration of pericardial surgery when the patient recovers.
Differentiating shock types is discussed more in the “Distractors” section.

Distractors:
Anaphylactic – Anaphylactic shock and septic shock have largely the same pathophysiology. They're both brought about by a systemic activation of the immune system and both result in vasodilation in the peripheries. Patients will typically have a high heart rate, low blood pressure and increase cardiac output secondary to systemic inflammation. They will often have a characteristic history of exposure to a known allergen such as a bee sting or peanut butter.
Cardiogenic – the differentiation between obstructive and cardiac shock can be difficult and this is what this question is testing largely. Cardiac shock should be thought of as when the heart is unable to continue functioning due to an intrinsic defect, i.e. the heart itself is diseased. Examples of this include myocardial infarction, free wall rupture (post-MI), valvular disease or rarely conditions such as myocarditis. On the other hand, obstructive shock is when the heart is unable to pump secondary to an extrinsic defect. Common examples of this include pulmonary embolism or pericardial tamponade. Both of these can be thought of something external to the heart (in this case, fluid in the pericardium) OBSTRUCTING mechanically its ability to function in the systolic and diastolic phase.
Neurogenic – Neurogenic shock is relatively uncommon form of shock typically seen in damage to the sympathetic nervous system either in the spinal cord or peripherally. It is typified by a systemic vasodilation with paradoxical reduction in heart rate (bradycardia) in the context of hypotension, reflecting an inability of the sympathetic nervous system to engender vasoconstriction due to the neural insult. This is a distributive shock, where blood is distributed inappropriately. A patient’s peripheries may be warm due to inappropriate vasodilation; though, they will typically have a reduction in cardiac output due to the loss of contractility and bradycardia (remember Cardiac output = Stroke volume x Heart rate). Typical causes include neural trauma, stroke and other CNS insults.
Septic – this is usually in the context of severe systemic infection, such as from the respiratory or urological system. Typically patients will be febrile, tachypnoeic, tachycardic and hypotensive. Systemic inflammatory response leads to immune activation throughout the body, leading to peripheral vasodilation, pooling, and further decompensation. Patients will typically have warm peripheries and an increased cardiac output, in contrast to all other forms of shock (except anaphylactic, as seen above).

She has had numerous episodes in the past, though the slow recovery from this one finally prompted her mother to bring her in. Her physical examination is unremarkable except for a triple apical impulse. In your routine workup for her, you perform an ECG which confirms your suspicions. 
Which of the following abnormalities would be most consistent with this genetic disease?","[""Deep, dagger-like Q waves in inferior and lateral leads"", ""An RSR\u2019 pattern in V1 and V2"", ""Universally low voltages in the praecordial leads"", ""Diffuse ST elevation and PR depression"", ""Prominent U waves with a normal QTc""]",A,"Deep, dagger-like Q waves in inferior and lateral leads","Jenny is likely a patient suffering from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). This is evidenced by her recurrent exertional syncope and young age. ECG findings in HOCM include left ventricle hypertrophy and stiletto (deep, dagger-like) Q waves.
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is an inherited disorder which is characterised by an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. It is classified as a disorder of cardiac muscle and leads to a hypertrophy of the ventricles especially. There is a number of genetic foci which can lead to mutations in sarcomere proteins, but all will culminate in a thickened ventricle. Common physical findings include a triple apical impulse and stigmata of heart failure such as pulmonary oedema. A patient may also report feelings of dizziness, angina, and palpitation. There may be unexplained syncope as well; especially occurring in the context of sport. Diagnosis is typically made an echocardiogram, cardiac catheterisation, and ECG. Cardiac catheterisation will reveal a Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign in HCM in order to differentiate it from aortic stenosis. After a premature ventricular contraction, the fixed obstruction of aortic stenosis will behave differently to the variable obstruction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment may include use of beta blockers as well as surgery in cases for improvement of severe disease, such as a ventricular myotomy.

Distractors:
An RSR’ pattern in V1 and V2 – This would be indicative of a right bundle branch block, which is typically seen in the context of conduction disorders (such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease) in older patients.
Diffuse ST elevation and PR depression – This is classical for pericarditis, which is unlikely in Jenny.
Prominent U waves with a normal QTc – This would indicate hypokalaemia or sometimes thyrotoxicosis and antiarrhythmic use. It can occur in the congenital long QT syndrome, but the normal QTc makes this unlikely.
Universally low voltages in the praecordial leads – This is usually in the case where something is “in the way” of the chest leads from reading the voltages. Think conditions like obesity or lung hyperinflation (COPD.)

Her age, pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension and tachycardia in the context of recent surgery point to venous thromboembolism. The key to this question is noting this patient’s contrast allergy. Typically, the first line investigation in suspected pulmonary embolism (once the patient is stabilised!) is CT Pulmonary Angiogram. However, this requires contrast and so is absolutely contraindicated in patients with a known contrast allergy.
Once this is confirmed (or even before if your clinical suspicion is high), treatment will consist of immediate anticoagulation in all cases and thrombolysis if the patient is unstable haemodynamically.
Distractors:
CT Pulmonary Angiogram – this is absolutely contraindicated in contrast allergy (as well as severe renal dysfunction) and so should not be used. In cases where this is not present, it would be first line for PE.
Erect Chest X-ray – this is best performed before a CTPA in order to rule out non-PE pathology, but is not the best investigation to confirm the diagnosis.
High Resolution Chest CT – this is the best investigation when there is parenchymal damage of the lung which may otherwise be hard to visualise, such as in interstitial lung disease.
Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy – this is largely unhelpful in evaluating respiratory pathology. If, for example, Lauren had a history of NSAID abuse, H. Pylori gastritis or known varices you may worry about an acute UGI bleed.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","[""Pericarditis"", ""Aortic dissection"", ""AMI"", ""Pulmonary embolism"", ""Ruptured abdominal aneurysm""]",B,Aortic dissection,"Aortic dissection is a condition where a tear occurs in the aortic wall intima, allowing blood to flow into a new false channel. Patients complain of a sudden severe ripping chest pain, that can radiate to the back and/or abdomen. Clinically, patients can experience a decreased blood flow to peripheral vessels leading to a decrease in pulse strength and a difference in blood pressure on the right and left side of the body. An aortic dissection that affects the aortic valve can lead to a new diastolic murmur (aortic regurgitation). Common risk factors to be aware of are hypertension, smoking, connective tissue disorders, pre-existing aortic aneurysm and bicuspid aortic valve. 

Distractors:

AMI  is wrong. Though it is an important differential to consider and rule out it presents differently. The central chest pain is more commonly described as a central crushing/squeezing pain that can radiate to the arm and neck. Patients often feel short of breath, dizzy and experience diaphoresis. 

Pulmonary embolism is wrong. Though it's possible to get acute severe chest pain, in a PE it would be pleuritic. Additionally, the clinical signs the patient is experiencing does not match up with a PE picture. 

Pericarditis is wrong. Chest pain radiating to the back is a feature of pericarditis, however, it would more commonly present as a sharp, stabbing chest pain that's relieved leaning forwards. In the examination it’s common to hear a pericardial rub (squeaky noise), which is heard best at the left sternal edge with the patient leaning forward. 

Abdominal Aortic aneurysm is wrong. Though it can present similarly to aortic dissection with sudden onset pain, it usually features pain in the abdomen. In a ruptured AAA, hypotension would be expected, as well as worse pain when lying down. On examination one would see and feel a pulsatile abdominal mass.

Although fairly uncommon in the western world, it still disproportionately affects the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Alira’s “strep throat” would have actually been Rheumatic Fever in which she would have experienced Carditis, leading to damage of the valves in her heart and valvular abnormalities. The most commonly affected valve in rheumatic fever is the mitral valve. In younger patients, mitral regurgitation is commonly heard. Older patients may present with stenosis instead, especially if they had subsequent flares. 

The best location to hear the mitral valve is the 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line. Mitral and aortic (lef heart) sounds are best heard on expiration as the pulmonary vessels constrict and push blood into the left side of the heart. 

Distractors:

Mid diastolic, 4th Intercostal Space, Left Sternal Edge on inspiration is incorrect as this would be characteristic of tricuspid stenosis. The tricuspid valve is affected in only 10% of Rheumatic Heart Disease. 

Ejection systolic, Second Intercostal Space, Right Sternal Border on expiration is incorrect because this is characteristic of an aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is not commonly seen in Rheumatic heart disease and Alira is likely too young to have stenotic valves as a result of RHD.

Harold describes this pain as a sudden onset of a centrally crushing discomfort in his chest radiating to his left arm, felt whilst watching television on the couch. He also experienced shortness of breath as he got up and walked to his bedroom. He experienced two similar episodes of chest discomfort yesterday, while at rest and with associated dyspnea on minimal exertion. Each episode lasted about 5 minutes resolved gradually and he is currently symptom free. The chest pain did not change with movement or respiration and was not localized on palpation. Previously Harold could climb 2 flights of stairs before getting SOB with chest discomfort, but can no longer do this.



His past medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe osteoarthritis of the knees. He is an ex-smoker with a 20 pack-year smoking history. His father had coronary artery disease and suffered an AMI before the age of 50. In terms of medication he is currently on amlodipine and atorvastatin.



His physical exam did not reveal any murmurs or additional heart sounds. He did not appear to be diaphoretic or have any nausea. His vitals were all within normal  except he was tachycardic at 110 and BP of 145/90. 



Chest XR was normal, cardiac biomarkers were not elevated and his initial ECG was normal.  



How would you manage Harold?","[""Discharge home with nitroglycerin spray and aspirin for primary prevention"", ""Aspirin, admit and obtain serial troponin, consider serial ECG"", ""IV morphine, IV nitrates, oxygen, aspirin"", ""Discharge home with an outpatient exercise stress testing""]",B,"Aspirin, admit and obtain serial troponin, consider serial ECG","This scenario is describing Harold, who has angina pectoris (undiagnosed stable ischemic heart disease), and is currently experiencing unstable angina. His previous episodes of angina were central chest discomfort of a stable pattern, predictably precipitated by exertion, lasting up to 3 minutes and resolving with rest, indicating typical angina, but it has not been diagnosed or treated as such.

For the last two days his angina has come on at rest, is more frequent and longer in duration up to 5 minutes, which is indicative of unstable angina. The underlying pathology is usually platelet aggregation secondary to athersclerotic plaque rupture, with the thrombus dissolving and not resulting in a troponin elevation. Unstable angina can be a precursor to an AMI. 

The initial evaluation of the patient would be through the ACS pathway, and the patient would be given aspirin (unless contraindicated)  and sublingual nitrates (unless contraindicated).  Usually if the first ECG and troponin are normal, serial troponin and ECG are obtained to reliably rule out an AMI. The HEART score is a useful clinical tool that is often used in the ED in patients suspected of an ACS (with no evidence of STE) to risk stratify patients and guide their management and disposition; a serial troponin is required in conjunction to increase the sensitivity of the HEART score.

Harold would receive a HEART score of 5, making him intermediate risk and requiring admission for further monitoring to ensure there is no progression to a STEMI.  

Further management while at hospital is based on risk stratification which takes into account clinical features, nature of the chest pain, presence of ECG changes or elevated troponin levels. The GRACE score is also used in patients with known ACS to determine mortality risk and assists in risk stratification. There is evidence for invasive management with revascularization in Non-ST Elevation ACS, and patients are risk stratified to very high, high and intermediate to determine duration until invasive management and revascularization. 

Harold would be low risk for mortality and recurrent events upon stratification (not fitting into very high, high or intermediate), therefore he would eventually have outpatient (or inpatient) stress testing to assess the extent of coronary artery disease and prognosis. 

Distractors:

Discharge home with an outpatient exercise stress testing is incorrect because firstly an AMI needs to be ruled out with a serial troponin and ECG, the patient requires antiplatelet therapy as this is suspicious for a NSTEACS and they need to be monitored for progression to an AMI. Stress testing will eventually need to be done for prognostic purposes and to guide further management. This might be done prior to discharge (if there is concern about loss to follow- up) and not necessarily only as an outpatient. 

IV morphine, IV nitrates, oxygen, aspirin is incorrect because IV nitrates are given if pain relief is not adequate with sublingual nitrates. Morphine is indicated if there is severe, persistent chest pain that is not relieved otherwise (although often given simultaneously in real life). Finally oxygen is only given as needed to maintain sats above 90% and Harold has normal O2 saturation. 

Discharge home with nitroglycerin spray and aspirin for primary prevention is incorrect as the patient is experiencing ACS and requires aspirin, nitrates, admission to hospital for further  testing. If the patient were low risk for ACS  based on the HEART score, and this were stable angina/low risk chest pain they could potentially be discharged without further intervention. Furthermore, the long term management of angina would include continuing statin, a switch to perindopril, aspirin for primary prevention of ACS and 2 anti-anginal agents including a beta blockers (first line) and either a long acting nitrate or calcium channel blocker.

Distractors:

Pneumonia – Pneumonias are a common cause of chest pain. It is also frequently associated with shortness of breath, and occasionally haemoptysis as described by Sam. However, pneumonia is incorrect as it would cause a patient to be febrile and would be associated with changes on auscultation of the chest such as bronchial breathing or crackles. 

Lung Cancer – Lung cancer can present with chest pain, shortness of breath and haemoptysis. Additionally, Sam does have risk factors for lung cancer, including an active colorectal cancer (which can metastasise to the lungs) and a smoking history. However, the acute setting of this presentation and lack of constitutional symptoms (loss of weight) makes it significantly less likely. Additionally, lung cancer would not cause the sinus tachycardia this patient is experiencing.

Unstable angina – Sam does have many risk factors for ischaemic heart disease: overweight BMI, smoking history, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and age. However, as the pain has lasted constantly for 8 hours and is associated with haemoptysis, this makes unstable angina much less likely. Additionally, the nature of the pain (pleuritic, rather than crushing and radiating to the left arm and jaw) makes unstable angina unlikely. 

STEMI - Sam does have many risk factors for ischaemic heart disease: overweight, smoking history, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and age. However, the nature of the pain (pleuritic, rather than crushing and radiating to the left arm and jaw) and lack of ST elevation on ECG, makes STEMI incorrect.

What is the likely diagnosis?","[""Infective endocarditis"", ""Septic arthritis"", ""Reactive arthritis"", ""Acute rheumatic fever""]",D,Acute rheumatic fever,"This is a case of Acute Rheumatic Fever, which can be diagnosed using the Jones Criteria (picture below). Acute Rheumatic fever is a non-suppurative complication of Group A Strep infection and can occur within  1 week but usually occurs 2-4 weeks  after infection with GAS (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media) especially when it remains untreated or undertreated. This scenario is describing  the more common form of  ARF with arthritis and  rheumatic carditis/valvulitis. Clinical manifestations described in this stem include “migratory” polyarthritis, arthralgia, rheumatic carditis clinically manifested the “Carey Coombs murmur” indicating moderate-severe mitral regurgitation due to acute mitral valvulitis.  Rheumatic carditis might progress to chronic valvular lesions (from one or recurrent episodes of ARF) leading to permanent destruction of the heart valve, at which point it is referred to as rheumatic heart disease. In RHD the mitral valve is most commonly involved with mitral regurgitation being the most common pathology.



A diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is defined as:

Initial episode—two major, or one major plus two minor, manifestations (see Table 2.62) plus evidence of preceding S. pyogenes infection

Recurrent episode—two major, or one major plus one minor, or three minor, manifestations (see Table 2.62) plus evidence of preceding S. pyogenes infection.

Distractors:
Reactive arthritis is incorrect because there is no evidence of another infection such as the presence of gastrointestinal(e.g. Salmonella, Shigella) or urinary symptoms (chlamydia, gonnorrhea).

Infective endocarditis is incorrect because there is no evidence of chills and rigors suggesting bacteremia,  IVDU or other stigmata of infective endocarditis such as splinter hemorrhage. Usually Strep Viridians is the strep that causes  IE and this can be differentiated on antigen testing. The preceding pharyngitis, arthralgia/arthritis, valvulitis and fever fit the manifestation of ARF better. Duke’s criteria is used to diagnose IE and the stem does not satisfy the criteria for diagnosis. However, rheumatic heart disease or other structural heart disease  is a risk factor for development of  infective endocarditis.

Septic arthritis is incorrect because it doesn’t explain the rash and valvulitis; bilateral arthritis would be unlikely in septic arthritis and migratory arthralgia from the wrist to the knees would also not be explained by septic arthritis. The patient would not be able to weight-bear on the affected limb. You may also see evidence of an entry point through the skin such as a cut.

It can present with dyspnoea, atypical chest pain and occasionally abdominal pain secondary to hepatic congestion.  On examination cardiac tamponade is characterised by Becks triad, consisting of an elevated Jugular venous pulse, Hypotension and Distant heart sounds. The patient may also be tachycardic and has pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated fall in blood pressure during inspiration >10 mmHg).  In this case, the patient has suffered from a ventricular rupture of necrotic ventricular wall, a potential complication post myocardial infarction (MI) which can occur in the days following the infarction, and this has led to a haemopericardium with tamponade. Once diagnosed, an emergency pericardiocentesis is indicated to remove the pericardial fluid. Other non-MI related causes of cardiac tamponade include trauma, cardiac surgery, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, aortic dissection or a rupture of an aneurysm. 

Distractors:

Acute Pericarditis is incorrect.  Pericarditis is characterised by chest pain which can radiate to the back, and a pericardial rub.  Dressler's pericarditis is a complication that can occur following a myocardial infarction but this is a late complication which typically occurs in the weeks following an MI.  It would be unlikely to occur a few days following MI and would not present in this manner.

Acute Pulmonary Oedema is incorrect.  It would usually present sooner as a more immediate complication of an MI.  Furthermore, it would present with other right heart failure signs such as ascites and hepatomegaly.

Ventricular Fibrillation is incorrect.  It would usually present sooner as a more immediate complication of an MI with palpitations and collapse. 

Papillary Muscle Rupture is incorrect.  Although this is a potential complication of a myocardial infarction in the days following the initial infarct, a papillary muscle rupture will cause signs and symptoms of valvular incompetence.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is incorrect as it has limited utility in AAA. It is an alternative to conventional angiography and CT angiography, eliminating the need for ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast media, and sometimes contrast media altogether. 

Abdominal X-ray is incorrect as it is not diagnostic for AAA. It may be used for evaluation of bowel gas or free gas. 

Computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is incorrect as it  is a diagnostic examination to exclude pulmonary emboli.

This child is experiencing a TET spell due to Tetralogy of Fallot.  Tetralogy of Fallot is characterised by pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, a large ventricular septal defect and an overriding aorta. It is the most common cyanotic heart defect and usually presents with episodes called TET spells where the child experiences cyanosis, can go floppy (infant) and can lose consciousness.  It is usually triggered during physical exertion such as crying and exercise, as cardiac demand increases. TET spells are usually self-limiting, but if severe, the main immediate management is to put the child on their side and bring their knees to their chest, which kinks the femoral arteries, hence increasing afterload and left ventricular pressure.  This pressure is enough to overcome the right to left shunt and hence force blood into the pulmonary circulation.  Further management includes Morphine intramuscularly and oxygen.  If the TET spell is prolonged then IV fluids and sodium bicarbonate may be indicated. Long term and more definitive management is surgical correction of the ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis, which will resolve the hypertrophy and overriding aorta.

Distractors:

IV fluids is incorrect.  IV fluids may be indicated later on if the TET spell is prolonged, but they are not the first immediate intervention.

Heels to bottom is incorrect. There is no evidence to suggest that putting heels to bottom does anything of benefit to help TET spells.

Bicarbonates is incorrect.  Sodium bicarbonate may be indicated later on if the TET spell is prolonged, but they are not the first immediate intervention.

Morphine is incorrect.  Although it plays a role in the initial management of a TET spell, the first immediate management is to put the child in a knees to chest position.

What is the most likely diagnosis?","[""Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)"", ""Acute pulmonary oedema"", ""Acute coronary syndrome"", ""Pneumonia"", ""Congestive heart failure""]",E,Congestive heart failure,"This man has congestive heart failure as consistent with his symptoms of dyspnoea, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, fatigue, chest discomfort and palpitations. He also has examination findings consistent with congestive heart failure with an elevated JVP (JVP visible >4cm above sternal angle), ankle oedema and bi-basal crackles. Risk factors for CHF are ageing, hypertension and ischaemic heart disease which also fits this man’s clinical picture. His overall picture would suggest Class II-III of congestive heart failure (mild-moderate CHF) and diagnosis should be established with tests like a chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiography, stress imaging and BNP tests.

Distractors:

Pneumonia is incorrect as he presents afebrile and his symptoms do not appear infective eg. no fever, no cough. Additionally, pneumonia is unlikely to cause an elevated JVP and may have other findings like bronchial breath sounds and coarse crackles.

Acute coronary syndrome consists of a STEMI, NSTEMI or unstable angina. Given this man’s clinical history with 3 weeks of symptoms and a lesser focus on symptoms such as chest pain, this is much less likely although should still be definitively ruled out with investigations eg. ECG.

COPD is a possible diagnosis given his smoking history and respiratory and fatigue symptoms however he has no cough or wheeze and importantly his symptoms have only been present for 3 weeks with no earlier history of dyspnoea.

Acute pulmonary oedema would present with a much shorter time course and more significant acute symptoms eg. severe dyspnoea, pallor, distress, sweats, tachycardia. This can be an acute presentation on a background of congestive heart failure but may also present de novo or be precipitated by other things like COPD exacerbation, anaphylaxis or pericarditis.

The patient is hypotensive and experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath. As his condition is unstable, the next most likely step of management is synchronised DC shock, followed by IV amiodarone infusion. 

Distractors:

IV amiodarone is incorrect. Amiodarone is used to treat ventricular tachycardia but as the patient’s condition is unstable, amiodarone is given followed by synchronised DC shock. 

IV Adenosine is incorrect as it is given to patients suffering from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). IV Adenosine is given to the patient if vagal maneuver fails to resolve the SVT episode. 

IV atropine is incorrect because it is used to treat bradyarrhythmias. Atropine is an anticholinergic agent which increases the heart rate. 

Vagal maneuver is incorrect because it is performed to treat supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). It is the first line management for SVT.

This is when the duct that connects the descending aorta to the pulmonary artery in utero, fails to close. It is typically asymptomatic, as in Lily’s case, unless it is particularly large and then it can cause symptoms of heart failure (shortness of breath, failure to thrive). It causes a typically continuous ‘machine-like murmur’ and is associated with bounding peripheral pulses. There are two main risk factors that predispose a baby to PDA: prematurity and congenital rubella infection. The former is relevant in Lily’s case, as she was born at 34 weeks gestation.

Distractors:

Atrial septal defect (ASD) - An ASD is a defect allowing blood flow between the atrium so that blood is shunted from the left atrium to the right atrium and then sent to the lungs. While it is typically also asymptomatic, this answer is incorrect as it is associated with a different murmur (soft ejection systolic murmur over the left sternal border and fixed splitting of S2). Lily not having any dysmorphic features - which may indicate Down’s Syndrome - also makes ASD less likely, as these two are frequently associated.  

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) - A VSD is a defect allowing blood flow between the ventricles. It is the most common congenital heart defect. However, it is incorrect as it is associated with a different murmur (soft pansystolic murmur with a loud P2). 

Tetralogy of Fallot - Tetralogy of Fallot refers to a collection of 4 changes: pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, a large VSD and overriding aorta. This answer is incorrect as this defect is associated with a different murmur (harsh ejection systolic murmur), signs of heart failure (shortness of breath, failure to thrive, sweating) and cyanosis. 

Coarctation of the aorta - Coarctation of the aorta refers to a narrowing of the aorta which limits perfusion to the lower limbs. It is incorrect as it is typically symptomatic and associated with lower limb cyanosis, an absence of femoral pulses and hypertension in the upper limbs. Additionally it is not associated with the murmur noted in Lily.

Distractors:

Myocardial infarction is incorrect as this patient has normal cardiac biomarkers and no other evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia. 

Pulmonary embolism is incorrect as he does not exhibit the common symptoms of PE such as dyspnoea and there was no evidence of PE found on the ECG. The key ECG findings for PE include sinus tachycardia, complete or incomplete right bundle branch block, right ventricular strain pattern,  right axis deviation, S1Q3T3 pattern etc. 

Pneumothorax is incorrect as it usually presents with acute dyspnea and chest pain. Physical examination of a patient with pneumothorax will show decreased chest expansion of the affected side, diminished breath sounds, absent tactile or vocal fremitus and hyperresonant percussion along with labored breathing or accessory muscle use. These features are also absent in this patient. 

Costochondritis is incorrect as it is a musculoskeletal chest wall pain with tenderness in multiple areas over the costochondral or costosternal junctions and palpation reproduces the pain. Therefore, the clinical presentation of this patient is inconsistent with costochondritis.

In addition, the murmur heard is classic of aortic stenosis, and thus this is the correct answer. Aortic stenosis tends to become increasingly common with age, but also can occur secondary to a congenital bicuspid valve or from valvular scarring secondary to rheumatic heart disease.

Distractors:

Aortic Regurgitation
Aortic Regurgitation may present similarly with shortness of breath and dizziness; however, the murmur is classically an early diastolic murmur, louder on expiration and is associated with a large pulse pressure. Hence, this is not the correct answer.

Mitral Stenosis
Mitral stenosis commonly occurs secondary to rheumatic heart disease, and thus tends to be more common in ATSI populations with a mid-diastolic murmur, louder on expiration, best heard at the apex of the heart. Consequently, the murmur heard in this scenario and the absence of risk factors means this is not the correct answer.

Mitral Regurgitation
Mitral regurgitation may present with palpitations, fatigue and dyspnea, but the murmur heard is a pan systolic murmur, louder on expiration, with radiation to the axilla. Consequently, this is not the right answer.

Tricuspid regurgitation
Tricuspid regurgitation may occur secondary to IVDU (with damage to the tricuspid valve) or from damage post AMI, and presents with a pansystolic murmur, louder on inspiration; hence this is not the correct answer.

Consequently, treatment of APO should include upright positioning for patient comfort, diuresis (frusemide) to counter the fluid overload, as well as oxygen to maintain the patient’s saturation above 94%. In cases where this is not enough, nitrate therapy (GTN) can be added with careful consideration of the patient’s blood pressure. Further intervention may involve non-invasive ventilation via CPAP with 100% oxygen to further alleviate the APO, with morphine given if the patient is unable to tolerate the CPAP due to anxiety. The management of APO can be remembered through the mnemonic “LMNOP”, which stands for Lasix (frusemide), morphine, nitrates, oxygen and position/positive airway pressure. Thus, in this scenario, oxygen and frusemide should be given.

Commence therapeutic clexane immediately and arrange for a CTPA:  This may be a suitable management plan if a PE was suspected, which can present with sudden onset shortness of breath. However, a PE is not as likely in this scenario. If one was to use the Well’s Score for PE, a tool which determines how clinically likely it is for a patient to have a PE, the score would be zero indicating low risk of PE. Hence, this is not the correct answer.

Commence IV benzylpenicillin and doxycycline: This may be a suitable management plan for an individual who has pneumonia. Whilst the patient indeed has shortness of breath and a cough with white sputum, the likelihood of pneumonia is still low given the picture of fluid overload, the absence of a fever or pleuritic chest pain or yellow-green sputum and the bibasal crackles are more classic of fluid overload opposed to pneumonia. Hence, this is not correct.

Commence GTN patch and aspirin immediately: This would be an appropriate initial management plan for an individual suspected of having an MI. Whilst the patient does indeed have a vasculopathic history, and this could be an atypical presentation of an MI, the clear precipitant of a new medication is more suggestive of triggering acute pulmonary oedema. In addition, the ECG does not show any evidence of acute infarction, thus making this option less appropriate. Furthermore, giving another NSAID in the setting of the “triple whammy” may further worsen the patient's clinical status.

Commence a cardioselective beta-blocker and spironolactone: This, in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor, would be highly suitable for the long-term management of heart failure, but is not useful in the acute setting and giving a beta-blocker acutely may further worsen the patient’s fluid overload and lead to cardiogenic shock. Consequently, this is not the correct answer.

He has a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 120 bpm. Upon examination, he has a pulsatile abdominal mass located centrally, with a positive Grey Turner’s sign.

Which of the following is known as a significant risk factor for the condition he presents with?","[""Diabetes"", ""Alcohol dependence"", ""Gallstones"", ""Marfan Syndrome"", ""Smoking""]",E,Smoking,"Smoking is the correct answer. The most likely diagnosis for Max's current presentation is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), characterised by the classic triad of: abdominal pain radiating to the back, hypotension and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Aortic aneurysms are abnormal dilations in the aorta of more than 1.5 times the expected anteroposterior diameter. They are most commonly caused by atherosclerosis, but can also be caused by infection or may be congenital. Smoking is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic AAA.

Distractors:
Diabetes: this is incorrect as diabetes has actually been found to be a protective factor against AAA, although the mechanism behind this is still unclear.

Marfan syndrome: this is a congenital connective tissue disorder that can cause weakening of the vessel wall, thus increasing the risk of aneurysms and aneurysm rupture. However, Marfan syndrome is very rarely associated with AAA, and is more commonly linked to aortic root aneurysms and dissecting aneurysms in the thoracic aorta.

Alcohol dependence: this is not considered a risk factor for AAA as the association between excessive alcohol use and AAA has not yet been established. Moderate alcohol consumption has been found to be inversely associated with AAA risk.

Gallstones: there is no association between gallstones and AAA (although gallstones may be a risk factor for other differentials including acute pancreatitis - although this would not present with a pulsatile mass unless there was a rare complication of a pancreatic pseudoaneurysm)

Considering her most likely diagnosis, which of the following investigations would be able to confirm this diagnosis?","[""CT pulmonary angiogram"", ""ECG"", ""Chest x-ray"", ""Echocardiogram"", ""D-dimers""]",A,CT pulmonary angiogram,"A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the correct answer. The likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism (PE), considering her clinical presentation and risk factor of having a hip fracture. A CTPA (or a V/Q scan) is required to provide a definitive diagnosis of a PE, and is indicated when there is a clinical suspicion for PE (Well's score >4, indicating an intermediate or high pre-test probability).

Distractors:

D-dimers: this is incorrect as D-dimers can only be used to rule out PE in patients with low or moderate probability on clinical assessment. It cannot be used to exclude PE in patients who already have a high clinical probability of PE. Furthermore, D-dimers are a breakdown product of blood clots, and if elevated, would indicate increased clot breakdown (and thus clot formation), however would not provide information about location or cause. If it is elevated, a CTPA, or a V/Q scan would be required to diagnose PE.

Chest X-ray: CXRs cannot diagnose PEs, but can be helpful in exploring differential diagnoses. A CXR of a patient with a PE may pick up signs such as pleural effusion or a wedge-shaped infarct.

ECG: cannot be used to diagnose PE, but findings may include sinus tachycardia, a right heart strain pattern, and a SIQIIITIII pattern (deep S wave in L1, Q wave and inverted T wave in L3) which is classically seen in PE, but not sensitive or specific.

Echocardiogram: this cannot reliably diagnose PE, however may be useful in patients who are haemodynamically unstable, in determining the presence of right ventricular dysfunction that may be brought about by PE.

TR refers to a faulty valve that allows backflow of blood into the RA from the RV. TR  is a pansystolic murmur (heard throughout pulsation) that is best heard on the lower left sternal edge, accentuated by inspiration. It usually presents with the triad of ankle oedema, pulsatile liver and giant V waves. Giant V-waves of the JVP usually flick up to the angle of the jaw and care needs to be taken to not be confused with fluid overload. Other findings could include a parasternal heave from pulmonary hypertension. 

Distractors:
Aortic stenosis: refers to a valve that is calcified and is difficult to push blood through. It is classically described as a crescendo-decrescendo murmur best heard at the right sternal edge radiating into the aortic area. It is accentuated by expiration and you should be able to palpate a slow carotid upstroke.
Mitral regurgitation: is a pansystolic murmur best heard at the apex of the heart radiating into the axilla, accentuated by expiration.

Aortic regurgitation: is classically described as an early diastolic decrescendo murmur best heard at the left sternal edge and is accentuated by inspiration. Other common findings are a water hammer pulse and prominent carotid pulsations.

The first step is to decide whether to provide rate or rhythm control. Factors supporting rhythm control in this patient are that she's young (<65 years), symptomatic and presenting with her 1st episode of atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control can be attained by electrical or pharmacological methods. Electrical cardioversion is generally preferred as studies have shown a higher success rate and less risk of pro arrhythmic side effects compared to pharmacological methods. AF of <48h onset requires anticoagulation with IV heparin pre DC cardioversion. AF of >48h duration requires at least 3 weeks of anticoagulation before cardioversion and continued for 4 weeks thereafter. Digoxin is used in rate control. Anticoagulation rather than aspirin is used pre DC cardioversion. Psychotherapies are not appropriate in acute symptomatic atrial fibrillation.

Digoxin toxicity can cause a number of arrhythmias apart from rapidly conducted arrhythmias eg. atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. It is most commonly associated with arrthymias such as atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 conduction, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with an alternating QRS axis or atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Non-compliance to digoxin might result in atrial fibrillation. There is no evidence of ST elevation.

Vasovagal syncope is a temporary phenomenon and would usually present with a normal ECG or sinus bradycardia due to increased vagal tone. 

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would show left ventricular hypertrophy, indicated by non-specific ST depression and T wave inversion in left sided leads. P mitral (bifid P waves) may occur due to compensatory left atrial hypertrophy.

Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition affecting cardiac sodium channels, leading to sudden cardiac death. Characteristic ECG findings include coved ST segment elevation in V1-V3 followed by a negative T wave (Brugada sign). This must be accompanied by clinical findings of either:

VF or VT
Family history of sudden cardiac death <45 years
Coved ECGs in family members
Inducible VT with electrical stimulation
Syncope
Nocturnal axonal respiration
There are no ST or T wave changes indicative of an acute myocardial infarct.
