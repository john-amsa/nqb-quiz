Clinical,Easy,"[""Gastroenterology""]","Paul, a 29-year-old male farmer presents to the emergency department with a 24-hour history of worsening abdominal pain that started in the umbilical region and has migrated to the right iliac fossa. He has had nausea for the past 6 hours and has vomited 3 times. About half an hour ago, the pain suddenly got much worse, and on the car ride here, every bump in the road made Paul scream with pain. He has no relevant medical history, no allergies, and has eaten nothing today. On examination there is generalised abdominal pain and guarding, and Paul has a temperature of 38.6˚ but is haemodynamically stable.

Your consultant has decided on Paul’s management plan and has referred to a surgeon.  She suggests you write up some antibiotics for Paul.

What regimen would be most appropriate to give Paul in this situation?","[""Gentamicin + amoxicillin + metronidazole"", ""Piperacillin + tazobactam"", ""Metronidazole"", ""Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (augmentin)"", ""Cephalexin""]",A,Gentamicin + amoxicillin + metronidazole,"From eTG:

Peritonitis due to perforated viscous is usually a polymicrobial infection with aerobic and anaerobic bowel flora. Surgery is usually required. For empirical therapy, use:

Clinical,Hard,"[""Gastroenterology""]","Jen, a 28-year-old woman, is brought to the doctor as she has been getting increasingly forgetful and confused over the past couple of months. She has also had some abdominal distension. On examination Jen has mild hepatomegaly and shifting dullness, as well as a shuffling gait and a slight tremor. A liver ultrasound shows cirrhosis. Jen thinks she may have had some family who suffered a similar kind of thing but is not certain.

Which of the following tests would be most useful to confirm the suspected diagnosis?","[""Iron studies"", ""Anti-smooth muscle antibodies"", ""Alpha-fetoprotein"", ""AST:ALT ratio"", ""Serum ceruloplasmin""]",E,Serum ceruloplasmin,"The correct answer is Serum ceruloplasmin. Jen is likely suffering from Wilson disease. This is a familial condition where copper accumulates in the body such as in the liver. It can cause liver dysfunction, haemolytic anaemia, and dementia. The accumulation can also show as Kayser-Fleischer rings in the eyes (gold rings).

Other options would be secondary differentials in cases such as this with a familial link, liver dysfunction and dementia.

Ferritin on iron studies would be raised in cases such as haemachromatosis. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are indicative of autoimmune hepatitis. Alpha-feto protein can indicate hepatocellular carcinoma. AST:ALT ratio can help to differentiate alcoholic and viral hepatitis.

E coli can cause toxic megacolon through infectious colitis however it is rarer and does not have an association with antibiotic use. Klebsiella is unlikely to cause infectious colitis and/or toxic megacolon. Strep mutans is normal as part of the GIT flora and does not cause toxic megacolon. C tetani causes muscle paralysis and is prevented using the tetanus vaccine.

Simon has never had pain of this nature before and cannot think of any triggers. He has only eaten his usual breakfast of cereal this morning. He has no relevant past medical history. On examination there is tenderness at a point between the right anterior superior iliac spine and the umbilicus.

""In the classic presentation [of appendicitis], the patient describes the onset of abdominal pain as the first symptom. The pain is typically periumbilical in nature with subsequent migration to the right lower quadrant as the inflammation progresses. Although considered a classic symptom, migratory pain occurs only in 50 to 60 percent of patients with appendicitis. Nausea and vomiting, if they occur, usually follow the onset of pain. Fever-related symptoms generally occur later in the course of illness.""

He has only eaten his usual breakfast of toast this morning. He has no relevant past medical history. On examination passive extension of the right hip elicits right lower quadrant pain.

Commonly described physical signs [of appendicitis] include:

●McBurney's point tenderness is described as maximal tenderness at 1.5 to 2 inches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on a straight line from the ASIS to the umbilicus (sensitivity 50 to 94 percent; specificity 75 to 86 percent).

●Rovsing's sign refers to pain in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quadrant. This sign is also called indirect tenderness and is indicative of right-sided local peritoneal irritation (sensitivity 22 to 68 percent; specificity 58 to 96 percent).

●The psoas sign is associated with a retrocecal appendix. This is manifested by right lower quadrant pain with passive right hip extension. The inflamed appendix may lie against the right psoas muscle, causing the patient to shorten the muscle by drawing up the right knee. Passive extension of the iliopsoas muscle with hip extension causes right lower quadrant pain (sensitivity 13 to 42 percent; specificity 79 to 97 percent).

●The obturator sign is associated with a pelvic appendix. This test is based on the principle that the inflamed appendix may lie against the right obturator internus muscle. When the clinician flexes the patient's right hip and knee, followed by internal rotation of the right hip, this elicits right lower quadrant pain (sensitivity 8 percent; specificity 94 percent). The sensitivity is low enough that experienced clinicians no longer perform this assessment.
